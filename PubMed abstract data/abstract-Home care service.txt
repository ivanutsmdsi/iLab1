OBJECTIVE: Literature suggests that home care professionals could be at higher 
risk of burnout than their colleagues in hospital settings, but research on 
home-based palliative care is still limited. Our study investigates psychosocial 
risk factors and burnout among workers involved in palliative care, comparing 
inpatient hospice, and home care settings.
METHOD: A cross-sectional study was carried out in a single palliative care 
organization providing inpatient hospice-based and home care-based assistance in 
a large urban area of Northern Italy. Participants completed a self-administered 
questionnaire collecting socio-demographic and occupational data, psychosocial 
risk factors, and burnout scales (Psychosocial Safety Climate 4; Conflict and 
Offensive Behavior - COPSOQ II; Work Life Boundaries; Work-home Interaction; 
Peer Support - HSE; Copenhagen Burnout Inventory).
RESULTS: The study sample included 106 subjects (95% of the overall eligible 
working population) who were predominantly female (68%) and nurses (57%), with a 
mean age of 41 years. Compared to inpatient hospice staff, home care workers 
reported more frequent communications with colleagues (p = 0.03) and 
patients/caregivers (p = 0.01), while there were no differences in the 
perception of work intrusiveness. Inpatient hospice workers showed lower peer 
support (p = 0.08) and lower psychosocial safety climate (p = 0.001) than home 
care colleagues. The experience of aggressive behaviors was rare, and it was 
relatively more frequent among inpatient hospice workers, female workers, and 
health assistants. Average scores of burnout scales were similar for both groups 
except for caregiver-related burnout, which was higher among inpatient hospice 
workers compared to home care colleagues (p = 0.008). The number of subjects at 
risk for work-related burnout was similar for both groups.
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Our study confirms the presence of psychological and 
physical fatigue in both home-based and inpatient hospice palliative care. 
Results suggest that home care assistance may not be characterized by higher 
psychological burden compared to inpatient hospice setting. Given the general 
tendency to increase home-based care in our aging population, it is essential to 
broaden the knowledge of psychosocial risks in this specific context to properly 
protect workers' health.

BACKGROUND: Working as a personal care assistant (PCA) with children and adults 
on mechanical ventilation in a home setting may be complex and challenging due 
to the physical and mental working conditions.
AIM: To explore the lived experience of working as a (PCA) with patients, 
children and adults on mechanical ventilation in the home setting.
DESIGN AND METHODS: A qualitative study using a phenomenological-hermeneutic 
approach. Data collection involved semi-structured individual interviews with 20 
PCAs (n = 15 women and n = 5 men) in Denmark in 2020. Their work experience with 
patients on home mechanical ventilation ranged from 8 months to 25 years (median 
8 years). The Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research checklist 
was used as a guideline.
FINDINGS: Four main themes emerged from the structural analysis: Being a fly on 
the wall or part of the family, Always being in a state of readiness is 
exhausting, Being a team player and Mutual respect is key in the work 
relationship.
CONCLUSION: PCAs had to balance on a knife's edge when working with children and 
adults on mechanical ventilation in the home setting and try to strike a happy 
medium. Enduring the job required a proper physical and mental work environment, 
and thorough preparation, achieved not only through technical training, but also 
through learning how to be part of a professional relationship characterised by 
mutual respect and matched expectations.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The findings provide clinical practice with 
important insights into how to inform, prepare and educate PCAs working with 
patients on mechanical ventilation in the home setting. Further research into 
home care education and training programmes with a patient- and family-centred 
care approach is needed.

BACKGROUND: The need for home care workers (HCWs) is rapidly growing in Norway 
due to the increasingly growing elderly population. HCWs are exposed to a number 
of occupational hazards and physically demanding work tasks. Musculoskeletal 
disorders, stress, exhaustion, high sick leave rates and a high probability of 
being granted a disability pension are common challenges. This qualitative study 
explored the views of HCWs on how working conditions affect their safety, 
health, and wellbeing.
METHODS: A descriptive and explorative design was utilised using semi-structured 
individual interviews with eight HCWs from three home care units in a 
middle-sized Norwegian city. Interviews were conducted in the Norwegian 
language, audio-recorded, and transcribed verbatim. The data was analysed by 
systematic text condensation. Key data quotes were translated into English by 
the authors.
RESULTS: HCWs reported that meaningful work-related interactions and 
relationships contributed to their improved wellbeing. Challenging interactions, 
such as verbal violence by consumers, were deemed stressful. The unpredictable 
work conditions HCWs encounter in users' homes contributed to their exposure to 
environmental hazards and unhealthy physical workloads. This was the case, 
although the employer promoted ergonomic work practices such as ergonomic body 
mechanics when mobilising and handling of clients, using safe patient handling 
equipment. HCWs perceived high level of individual responsibility for complying 
with company safety policies and practices, representing a health barrier for 
some. Organisational frameworks created unhealthy work conditions by shift work, 
time pressure and staffing challenges. Performing tasks in accordance with HCWs 
professional skills and identity was perceived as health-promoting.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that unpredictable working conditions at users' 
home can adversely affect the safety, health, and wellbeing of HCWs. The 
interaction between the unpredictable environment at users' homes, HCWs' 
perceived high level of individual responsibility for complying with company 
safety policies and practices, and staffing challenges due to sickness-related 
absences upon the workplace creates tense work conditions with a negative 
influence on HCWs health.

This systematic review and meta-analysis sought to explore the prevalence of 
sexual violence including both sexual harassment and abuse, perpetrated by 
clients against home healthcare workers (HCWs), including professional and 
paraprofessional HCWs. To this end, we systematically searched five relevant 
databases. Two reviewers extracted data from the included studies independently 
and performed a quality appraisal. Overall and subgroup random-effects pooled 
prevalence meta-analyses were performed. Due to high heterogeneity, a more 
robust model using a quality effect estimator was used. Fourteen studies were 
included, and the prevalence of sexual violence was 0.06 (95% confidence 
interval (CI): 0.01-0.13). Paraprofessionals had a higher prevalence of sexual 
violence (0.07, 95% CI: 0.00-0.18 vs. 0.05, 95% CI: 0.00-0.12), and the 
prevalence of sexual abuse was lower than that of sexual harassment (0.04, 95% 
CI: 0.00-0.10 vs. 0.10, 95% CI: 0.03-0.18). This systematic review estimated the 
prevalence of sexual violence across home HCWs from different high-income 
countries, highlighting the presence of this phenomenon to a lesser but 
nevertheless considerable extent compared to other healthcare settings. Health 
management should consider interventions to prevent and reduce the risk of home 
HCWs from being subjected to sexual violence, as the home-care sector presents 
particular risks for HCWs because clients' homes expose them to a relatively 
uncontrolled work environment.

Personal support workers (PSW) are caregivers for children and adults with 
intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) or adults experiencing mental 
illness or other behavioral health conditions. The work can be very meaningful, 
but many PSWs must prepare for, monitor, and manage challenging behaviors, 
including aggression. This study was designed to estimate the prevalence of 
aggression experienced by PSWs in Oregon, and compare it to a previous sample of 
Oregon home care workers (HCWs). This comparison included an analysis of 
relationships between exposures to aggression and psychological health factors. 
PSWs in Oregon (N = 240) were surveyed electronically at a single time point. 
PSWs generally reported higher rates of exposure to aggression compared to HCWs. 
Experiences with aggression were positively associated with fatigue and weakly 
associated with depression, but not stress. PSWs' self-reported lost work time 
injury rate was elevated compared to the US average, but it was comparable to 
previous self-reported injury rates from HCWs. Physical demands of work were the 
most prevalent reported primary safety concern, followed by challenging 
behaviors (including aggression). Developing tailored training to help PSWs 
understand, plan for, minimize, and manage challenging behaviors is a social 
priority.

This study aimed to investigate the levels of burnout and work engagement among 
home care workers in Switzerland and to test their association with job demands 
and job resources. We conducted a multi-centre, cross-sectional survey in the 
German-speaking part of Switzerland with a convenience sample of seven home care 
agencies. Data were collected between September 2017 and January 2018. We 
assessed burnout with the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and work engagement 
with the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) as well as job demands (overtime, 
work-family conflicts, experienced aggression and work stressors) and job 
resources (predictability, staffing, teamwork, leadership, collaboration, social 
support, sense of community, feedback). To investigate the levels of burnout and 
work engagement, we applied descriptive statistics. Based on Bakker and 
colleagues' Job Demands-Resources model, we used a path analysis to test the 
associations of job demands and job resources with burnout and work engagement. 
We analysed data from 448 home care workers (response rate 61.8%, mean age 
44 years (SD 13.2), 96% female). The frequency of burnout in our sample was low, 
while that of work engagement was high. Job demands correlated positively with 
emotional exhaustion (β = .54, p < .001) and negatively with work engagement 
(β = -.25, p < .001). Job resources correlated negatively with emotional 
exhaustion (β = -.28, p < .001) and positively with work engagement (β = .41, 
p < .001). Work-family conflicts and work stressors correlated strongest with 
emotional exhaustion, whereas social support and feedback were found to 
correlate strongest with work engagement. Improvements to the home care work 
environment might enhance work engagement and reduce burnout. Corrective 
interventions could focus on reducing specific aspects of job demands, such as 
work-family conflicts and work stressors, as well as on increasing aspects of 
job resources, especially social support and feedback.

Background: Home health care nurses (HHNs) work alone in patients' homes. They 
experience high rates of Type II (client/patient-on-worker) workplace violence 
(WPV); however, little is known about the extent and factors of their reporting. 
Methods: A convenience sample of employees aged 18 years and older and working 
as an HHN or management staff were recruited from a U.S. nonprofit home health 
care agency. To describe the extent of reporting of WPV events, an HHN survey 
was conducted. To identify the barriers and facilitators to reporting, two HHN 
focus groups were conducted, and management key informant interviews were 
employed. Findings: We recruited 18 HHNs and five management staff into the 
study. Almost all HHNs reported to management the most serious forms of violence 
they experienced, and that HHNs reported WPV when they perceived that reporting 
was beneficial (alerting other nurses and management) and supported by 
management staff. However, they were unwilling to report when it was perceived 
as disadvantageous (reliving the trauma), discouraged (by a norm that 
experiencing violence is a part of the job), unachievable (unstandardized 
reporting process), and ambiguous (uncertain of what is reportable). Management 
staff perceived a lack of standardized reporting processes as a barrier when 
responding to HHNs' reporting. Conclusion/Application to Practice: High 
reporting was related to strong support from management. Policies and procedures 
should clearly define WPV, the threshold for reporting, how to report, and how 
management will respond to the reports.

"That's not my job": A mixed methods study of challenging client behaviors, 
boundaries, and home care aide occupational safety and health.

Massachusetts.

INTRODUCTION: Home care (HC) aide is among the fastest-growing jobs. Aides often 
work in long-term care relationships with elders or people with disabilities in 
clients' homes, assisting with daily activities. The purpose of this 
mixed-methods paper is to elucidate aides' experiences around the 
boundary-challenging behaviors of clients asking for services beyond aides' job 
duties and to identify possible interventions.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of HC aides in Massachusetts (n = 1249) 
provided quantitative data. Post-survey qualitative data were collected from 
nine HC aide focus groups (n = 70) and seven in-depth interviews with HC 
industry and labor representatives.
RESULTS: Quantitatively, aides who reported often being asked to do tasks 
outside their job duties were more likely to report abuse (prevalence ratio 
[PR] = 1.93; 95%CI: 1.47-2.52 for verbal, PR = 1.81; 95%CI: 1.13-2.91 for 
physical/sexual) and pain/injury with lost work time or medical care (PR = 1.58; 
95%CI: 1.11-2.25). They were also less likely to want to remain in their job 
(PR = 0.94; 95%CI: 0.89-1.00) or recommend it to others (PR = 0.94; 95%CI: 
0.90-0.98). Qualitative data showed that clients' requests for tasks beyond job 
duties were frequent and can lead to injuries, abuse, and psychosocial stress. 
Yet, requests often reflected genuine need. Helping clients stay at home, 
compassion, and feeling appreciated contributed to job satisfaction; therefore, 
aides can feel conflicted about refusing requests.
CONCLUSION: Client task requests outside HC services are a complex problem. 
Employer support, training, care plans, and feeling part of a care team can help 
aides navigate professional boundaries while delivering high quality care.

INTRODUCTION: There is a need to evaluate whether, and to what degree, labour 
inspections or other regulatory tools have the desired effects on psychosocial, 
organisational and mechanical work environment, and employee health. The 
Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority (NLIA) uses different tools and strategies 
to enforce compliance with occupational safety and health (OSH) legislation. The 
aim of the present study is to evaluate the effects of labour inspections and 
other regulatory tools employed by the NLIA. The home-care service is one of the 
fastest growing occupations and a prioritised area for the NLIA, hence the 
present study will investigate regulatory tools in this sector.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The research project has been designed as a longitudinal, 
cluster-randomised, controlled trial and will be conducted among Norwegian 
home-care workers. The objective of the research project is to evaluate the 
effects of the NLIA's regulatory tools (inspection and guidance) on: (1) 
compliance with OSH legislation and regulation; (2) psychosocial, organisational 
and mechanical work environment; (3) employee health in terms of musculoskeletal 
and mental health complaints; and (4) sickness absence. Public home-care 
services have been randomised to three intervention groups and one control 
group. Home-care services in the intervention groups will receive one of three 
intervention activities from the NLIA: (1) inspection from the Labour Inspection 
Authority; (2) guidance through an online interactive risk-assessment tool; and 
(3) guidance on psychosocial, organisational and mechanical work environment 
through workshops. The interventions will be performed at the organisational 
level (home-care service), and the effects of the interventions on the working 
environment and health complaints will be measured at the individual level 
(home-care employees).
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This project has been approved by the Regional 
Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REC) in Norway (REC South 
East) (2018/2003/REK sør-øst C), the Norwegian Center for Research Data 
(566128), and will be conducted in accordance with the World Medical Association 
Declaration of Helsinki. The results will be reported in international 
peer-reviewed journals.

Family caregivers provide the vast majority of care for individuals with serious 
illness living in the community but are not often viewed as full members of the 
healthcare team. Family caregivers are increasingly expected to acquire a 
sophisticated understanding of the care recipient's condition and new skills to 
execute complex medical or nursing tasks, often without adequate preparation and 
support, and with little choice in taking on the role. This review draws on 
peer-reviewed literature, government reports, and other publications to 
summarize the challenges faced by family caregivers of older adults in the 
context of serious illness and to identify opportunities to better integrate 
them into the healthcare workforce. We discuss promising approaches such as 
inclusion of family caregivers in consensus-based practice guidelines; the "no 
wrong door" function, directing consumers to needed resources, regardless of 
where initial contact is made; and caregiver-friendly workplace policies 
allowing flexible arrangements. We present specific recommendations focusing on 
research, clinical practice, and policy changes that promote family-centered 
care and improve outcomes for caregivers as well as persons with serious 
illness. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:S451-S456, 2019.

The COMmunity of Practice And Safety Support (COMPASS) program was developed to 
prevent injuries and advance the health and well-being of home care workers. The 
program integrates elements of peer-led social support groups with scripted 
team-based programs to help workers learn together, solve problems, set goals, 
make changes, and enrich their supportive professional network. After a 
successful pilot study and randomized controlled trial, COMPASS was adapted for 
the Oregon Home Care Commission's training system for statewide dissemination. 
The adapted program included fewer total meetings (7 versus 13), an accelerated 
meeting schedule (every two weeks versus monthly), and a range of other 
adjustments. The revised approach was piloted with five groups of workers (total 
n = 42) and evaluated with pre- and post-program outcome measures. After further 
adjustments and planning, the statewide rollout is now in progress. In the 
adaptation pilot several psychosocial, safety, and health outcomes changed by a 
similar magnitude relative to the prior randomized controlled trial. Preliminary 
training evaluation data (n = 265) show high mean ratings indicating that 
workers like the program, find the content useful, and intend to make changes 
after meetings. Facilitating factors and lessons learned from the project may 
inform future similar efforts to translate research into practice.

PURPOSE: To analyze the long-term impact of bullying among healthcare providers 
(T1) on missed nursing care and quality of care 2 years later (T2) and to test 
the potential mediating effect of affective organizational commitment.
METHODS: Survey data from healthcare providers in the eldercare sector in 2006 
(T1) and 2008 (T2). At T1, 9212 employees participated in the survey and 5202 
participated in both T1 and T2. Including only participants who were directly 
engaged in the provision of care yielded 4000 providers, who were employed in 
268 workgroups at T1 and T2. Associations between exposure to bullying 
(predictor) and the two outcomes (missed nursing care and quality of care) were 
investigated using multi-level linear regression analysis. Included covariates 
were age, gender, job position, work place and tenure.
RESULTS: We found a significant association between workplace bullying at T1 and 
missed nursing care at T2 but not for quality of care at T2. Affective 
organizational commitment did not mediate the association between bullying and 
the two outcomes. However, affective organizational commitment at T1 was 
associated with quality of care at T2.
CONCLUSION: Exposure to bullying at work may cause the provider to miss nursing 
care for clients. To improve, care administrators should consider implementing 
bullying prevention strategies at three levels: organizational, work group and 
individual.

Given the social burden and significant cost of dementia care in Australia, 
finding evidence-based approaches that improve outcomes, maintain independence, 
and reduce the impact on patients and families is essential. Finding effective 
ways to train and assist the healthcare staff who support these individuals is 
also critical, as they are considered to be at risk of workplace stress, 
burnout, and other psychological disturbances which negatively affects standards 
of care. The current paper describes a protocol for evaluating the effects of a 
Montessori-based approach to dementia care, in non-residential respite centres. 
An 18 month prospective observational, cohort controlled design is suggested 
that will compare participants from a community respite service that has 
undergone a Montessori-based workplace culture change and those from a service 
that provides a person-centred 'care as usual' approach. To achieve this, the 
protocol includes the assessment of participants across multiple variables on a 
monthly basis including the cognitive, behavioural, and emotional functioning of 
clients with dementia, levels of caregiver burden experienced by informal 
carers, and burnout, compassion satisfaction and workplace engagement among 
respite staff. The protocol also employs a qualitative evaluation of program 
fidelity. This approach will provide further insight into the potential benefits 
of early intervention with Montessori approaches for persons living with 
dementia in the community, their caregivers, and the staff and volunteers who 
assist them.

Exploring Relationships Among Occupational Safety, Job Turnover, and Age Among 
Home Care Aides in Maine.

Butler SS(1).

As the U.S. population ages, the number of people needing personal assistance in 
the home care setting is increasing dramatically. Personal care aides and home 
health workers are currently adding more jobs to the economy than any other 
single occupation. Home health workers face physically and emotionally 
challenging, and at times unsafe, work conditions, with turnover rates ranging 
from 44 percent to 65 percent annually. As part of a mixed-method, longitudinal 
study in Maine examining turnover, interviews with 252 home care aides were 
analyzed thematically. Responses to interview questions regarding the job's 
impact on health and safety, the adequacy of training, and the level of agency 
responsiveness were examined. Emergent themes, indicating some contradictory 
perspectives on workplace safety, quality of training, and agency support, were 
compared across three variables: job termination, occupational injury, and age. 
Implications for increasing occupational safety and job retention are discussed.

BACKGROUND: While benefits of workplace physical exercise on physical health is 
well known, little is known about the psychosocial effects of such initiatives. 
This study evaluates the effect of workplace versus home-based physical exercise 
on psychosocial factors among healthcare workers.
METHODS: A total of 200 female healthcare workers (Age: 42.0, BMI: 24.1) from 18 
departments at three hospitals were cluster-randomized to 10 weeks of: 1) 
home-based physical exercise (HOME) performed alone during leisure time for 10 
min 5 days per week or 2) workplace physical exercise (WORK) performed in groups 
during working hours for 10 min 5 days per week and up to 5 group-based coaching 
sessions on motivation for regular physical exercise. Vitality and mental health 
(SF-36, scale 0-100), psychosocial work environment (COPSOQ, scale 0-100), work- 
and leisure disability (DASH, 0-100), control- (Bournemouth, scale 0-10) and 
concern about pain (Pain Catastrophizing Scale, scale 0-10) were assessed at 
baseline and at 10-week follow-up.
RESULTS: Vitality as well as control and concern about pain improved more 
following WORK than HOME (all p < 0.05) in spite of increased work pace 
(p < 0.05). Work- and leisure disability, emotional demands, influence at work, 
sense of community, social support and mental health remained unchanged. 
Between-group differences at follow-up (WORK vs. HOME) were 7 [95% confidence 
interval (95% CI) 3 to 10] for vitality, -0.8 [95% CI -1.3 to -0.3] for control 
of pain and -0.9 [95% CI -1.4 to -0.5] for concern about pain, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Performing physical exercise together with colleagues during 
working hours was more effective than home-based exercise in improving vitality 
and concern and control of pain among healthcare workers. These benefits 
occurred in spite of increased work pace.

Language Barrier as a Risk Factor for Injuries From Patient Violence Among 
Direct Care Workers in Home Settings: Findings From a U.S. National Sample.

Byon HD, Zhu S, Unick GJ, Storr CL, Lipscomb J.

This study explored potential risk factors for injuries from patient violence 
among direct care workers in U.S. homes (DCWHs). A national probability sample 
of 3,377 DCWHs including home health and personal care aides was analyzed using 
complex sample analysis and generalized estimating equation. Injury from 
violence was defined as a workrelated injury sustained by aggression, violence, 
or abuse that was reported to the agency, required medical attention or resulted 
in absenteeism from work. An association between suffering an injury from 
patient violence and having a language barrier with patients was noted (OR = 
4.44; 95% CI = 1.57, 12.56; p = .005). Findings illuminate the importance of 
homecare providers to match language between DCWHs and patients to reduce 
patient violence and improve quality of care in the home setting.

Exploring the Factor Structure of the Job Demands-Resources Measure With Patient 
Violence on Direct Care Workers in the Home Setting.

Byon HD, Harrington D, Storr CL, Lipscomb J.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Workplace violence research in health care settings 
using the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) framework is hindered by the lack of 
comprehensive examination of the factor structure of the JD-R measure when it 
includes patient violence. Is patient violence a component of job demands or its 
own factor as an occupational outcome?
METHOD: Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were 
conducted using a sample of direct care workers in the home setting (n = 961).
RESULTS: The overall 2-construct JD-R structure persisted. Patient violence was 
not identified as a separate factor from job demands; rather, two demand factors 
emerged: violence/emotional and workload/physical demands.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the three-factor model fits the data, the two-factor model 
with patient violence being a component of job demands is a parsimonious and 
effective measurement framework.

Trust, Seattle, Washington.

INTRODUCTION: A rate-based understanding of home care aides' adverse 
occupational outcomes related to their work location and care tasks is lacking.
METHODS: Within a 30-month, dynamic cohort of 43 394 home care aides in 
Washington State, injury rates were calculated by aides' demographic and work 
characteristics. Injury narratives and focus groups provided contextual detail.
RESULTS: Injury rates were higher for home care aides categorized as female, 
white, 50 to <65 years old, less experienced, with a primary language of 
English, and working through an agency (versus individual providers). In 
addition to direct occupational hazards, variability in workload, income, and 
supervisory/social support is of concern.
CONCLUSIONS: Policies should address the roles and training of home care aides, 
consumers, and managers/supervisors. Home care aides' improved access to 
often-existing resources to identify, manage, and eliminate occupational hazards 
is called for to prevent injuries and address concerns related to the 
vulnerability of this needed workforce.

Home care aides (HCAs), predominantly women, constitute one of the fastest 
growing occupations in the United States. HCAs work in clients' homes that lack 
typical workplace resources and benefits. This mixed-methods study examined how 
HCAs' work environment was transformed by a pilot workplace health promotion 
program that targeted clients as well as workers. The intervention started with 
training HCAs to deliver a gentle physical activity program to their older 
clients in a Medicaid-funded home care program. Older HCAs aged 50+ reported 
increased time doing the types of physical activity that they delivered to their 
clients (stretching or strengthening exercise) (p = 0.027). Almost all (98%) 
HCAs were satisfied with the program. These quantitative results were 
corroborated by qualitative data from open-ended survey questions and focus 
groups. HCAs described how they exercised with clients and how the psychosocial 
work environment changed with the program. Building physical activity into HCAs' 
job is feasible and can effectively promote HCAs' health, especially among older 
HCAs.

Today, we can see a trend toward increased psychosocial strain at work among 
home-care managers and staff. The aim of this study is to describe home care 
managers' views on their own psychosocial working conditions and on how to 
promote workplace health and safety in a municipality in northern Sweden. A 
mixed-methods design was used, including questionnaire and qualitative focus 
group data. The qualitative data were analyzed by manifest content analysis. The 
results indicate that most managers perceived increased variety in work and 
opportunities for development at work, but at the same time increased demands. 
The managers suggested that workplace health and safety could be improved by 
risk assessment and improved communication, a clear communication chain by a 
real as well as a virtual platform for communication. In summary, workplace 
health and safety could be improved by risk assessments and by a physical as 
well as a virtual platform for communication.

The bonds and relationships that direct care workers in the home setting (DCWHs) 
develop with their elderly or disabled home care patients may put them at risk 
for patient violence. This study used a data-driven approach, latent class 
analysis, to identify distinct underlying patterns of DCWH-patient relationships 
and then assessed how DCWH-patient class membership was associated with patient 
violence. This study analyzed survey data obtained from 964 DCWHs working in two 
not-for-profit home care agencies. Four classes of DCWH-patient relationships 
emerged: Non-familial (40% of the sample), Overly Concerned (14%); 
Boundary-keeping (22%), and Overly Involved (24%). DCWHs in the Overly Involved 
class were more likely to experience physical violence from their patients 
relative to those in the Non-familial class (probability = 0.11 vs. 0.04, 
p = 0.01). Building a positive relationship with boundaries between caregivers 
and patients may have a potential to reduce patient violence toward the 
caregivers and ultimately improve the quality of care.

Client history and violence on direct care workers in the home care setting.

Byon HD(1), Storr C(1), Edwards L(1), Lipscomb J(1).

Author information:
(1)School of Nursing, University of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland.

BACKGROUND: Health care workers providing home care are frequently unaware of 
their client's history of violence or mental illness/substance abuse disorder, 
recognized risk factors for workplace violence. This study estimated the 
associations between these factors and experiencing client violence among direct 
care workers in the home settings (DCWHs).
METHODS: Acts and threats of violence were estimated using data from an 
anonymous survey among DCWHs (n = 876) working at two large home care agencies. 
Logistic regressions were performed to produce odds ratios.
RESULTS: Physical acts and physical or verbal threats of client violence were 
associated with providing homecare to clients with a violence history (adjusted 
ORs = 6.60 and 10.78, respectively), whereas threats of client violence 
(adjusted OR = 5.80) were associated with caring for clients with a mental 
illness/substance abuse disorder.
CONCLUSIONS: Policy and practices that support the communication of appropriate 
client risk information may reduce the likelihood of workplace violence among 
DCWHs. Am. J. Ind. Med. 59:1130-1135, 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The objectives of the study were to profile occupational injury patterns across 
home health and hospice care (HHC), organization characteristics, and home 
health aides' (HHAs) individual characteristics, and examine how worker training 
affects HHAs' risk of reporting an injury using the model of human factors of 
health care in the home. The authors measured training knowledge using an 
11-item scale and conducted univariate and bivariate analyses to describe injury 
patterns across individual, occupational, and organizational factors using STATA 
12.0. The researchers found that work-related injuries and type of injury were 
associated with increased likelihood of reporting one or more injuries, 
full-time employment, high hourly pay, and working in an inpatient or mixed 
setting. Overall, HHAs perceived that they received "excellent" and "good" 
training on key topics that promoted safety and job knowledge. Furthermore, the 
results suggested linkages between worker's complex personal, occupational, and 
organizational characteristics.

BACKGROUND: In the rapidly growing home health and hospice industry, little is 
known about workplace violence prevention (WVP) training and violent events.
METHODS: We examined the characteristics of WVP training and estimated violent 
event rates among 191 home health and hospice care providers from six agencies 
in California. Training characteristics were identified from the Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration guidelines. Rates were estimated as the number 
of violent events divided by the total number of home visit hours.
RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2009, 66.5% (n = 127) of providers reported receiving 
WVP training when newly hired or as recurrent training. On average, providers 
rated the quality of their training as 5.7 (1 = poor to 10 = excellent). Among 
all providers, there was an overall rate of 17.1 violent events per 1,000 
visit-hours.
CONCLUSION: Efforts to increase the number of home health care workers who 
receive WVP training and to improve training quality are needed.

Targeting occupational health and safety interventions to different groups of 
employees and sectors is important. The aim of this study was to explore the 
environment-intervention fit of a Danish psychosocial work environment 
intervention program for the residential and home care sector. Focus group 
interviews with employees and interviews with mangers were conducted at 12 
selected workplaces and a questionnaire survey was conducted with managers at 
all 115 workplaces. The interventions enhanced the probability of employees 
experiencing more "good" work days, where they could make a difference to the 
lives of clients. The interventions may therefore be characterized as culturally 
compelling and having a good fit with the immediate work environment of 
employees. The interventions furthermore seemed to fit well with the wider 
organizational environment and with recent changes in the societal and economic 
context of workplaces. However, some workplaces had difficulties with involving 
all employees and adapting the interventions to the organization of work. The 
findings suggest that flexibility and a variety of strategies to involve all 
employees are important aspects, if interventions are to fit well with the care 
sector. The focus on employees' conceptualization of a "good" work day may be 
useful for intervention research in other sectors.

OBJECTIVES: In countries with ageing populations, home care (HC) aides are among 
the fastest growing jobs. There are few quantitative studies of HC occupational 
safety and health (OSH) conditions. The objectives of this study were to: (1) 
assess quantitatively the OSH hazards and benefits for a wide range of HC 
working conditions, and (2) compare OSH experiences of HC aides who are employed 
via different medical and social services systems in Massachusetts, USA.
METHODS: HC aides were recruited for a survey via agencies that employ aides and 
schedule their visits with clients, and through a labour union of aides employed 
directly by clients or their families. The questionnaire included detailed 
questions about the most recent HC visits, as well as about individual aides' 
OSH experiences.
RESULTS: The study population included 1249 HC aides (634 agency-employed, 615 
client-employed) contributing information on 3484 HC visits. Hazards occurring 
most frequently related to musculoskeletal strain, exposure to potentially 
infectious agents and cleaning chemicals for infection prevention and experience 
of violence. Client-hired and agency-hired aides had similar OSH experiences 
with a few exceptions, including use of sharps and experience of verbal 
violence.
CONCLUSIONS: The OSH experience of HC aides is similar to that of aides in 
institutional healthcare settings. Despite OSH challenges, HC aides enjoy caring 
for others and the benefits of HC work should be enhanced. Quantification of HC 
hazards and benefits is useful to prioritise resources for the development of 
preventive interventions and to provide an evidence base for policy-setting.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To study leadership factors and their associations with 
psychosocial work environmental among nursing assistants who are engaged in old 
age care and to analyse (i) differences in the assessment of leadership factors 
and the assessment of psychosocial work environmental in nursing homes and home 
help services and (ii) the association between the psychosocial work environment 
and factors that are related to leadership in nursing homes and home help 
services.
BACKGROUND: Leadership factors are an important element of the psychosocial work 
environment in old age care. The physical distance between leaders and nursing 
assistants is larger in home help services than in nursing homes. Therefore, it 
is important to study leadership separately in nursing homes and home help 
services.
DESIGN: Assessments from 844 nursing assistants in nursing homes and 288 in home 
help services (45 nursing homes and 21 home help service units) were analysed.
METHODS: The data were analysed using linear regression. Age, gender, number of 
staff at the unit, number of years at the current working unit and educational 
level were controlled in Model 1. Summarised indexes that were based on all 
independent variables except the main independent variable were additionally 
controlled in Model 2.
RESULTS: Psychosocial work environment was related to leadership factors, but 
stronger associations occurred more frequently in nursing homes than in home 
help services. Empowering leadership, support from superiors, the primacy of 
human resources and control over decisions were associated with higher 
assessments on all the variables that were related to the psychosocial work 
environment in both the nursing homes and home help services.
CONCLUSIONS: Organisational differences in conducting leadership in old age care 
must be considered. Some leadership characteristics are better prerequisites for 
creating and maintaining a positive psychosocial work environment for nursing 
assistants in nursing homes and home help services.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Due to the differences in organisational settings, it 
is important to consider the differences in prerequisites in conducting 
leadership. To influence nursing assistants' performance and to increase quality 
in old age care in the long term, appropriate leadership is necessary.

BACKGROUND: Consumer-driven homecare models support aging and disabled 
individuals to live independently through the services of homecare workers. 
Although these models have benefits, including autonomy and control over 
services, little evidence exists about challenges homecare workers may face when 
providing services, including workplace violence and the negative outcomes 
associated with workplace violence. This study investigates the prevalence of 
workplace violence among homecare workers and examines the relationship between 
these experiences and homecare worker stress, burnout, depression, and sleep.
METHODS: We recruited female homecare workers in Oregon, the first US state to 
implement a consumer driven homecare model, to complete an on-line or telephone 
survey with peer interviewers. The survey asked about demographics and included 
measures to assess workplace violence, fear, stress, burnout, depression and 
sleep problems.
RESULTS: Homecare workers (n = 1,214) reported past-year incidents of verbal 
aggression (50.3% of respondents), workplace aggression (26.9%), workplace 
violence (23.6%), sexual harassment (25.7%), and sexual aggression (12.8%). 
Exposure was associated with greater stress (p < .001), depression (p < .001), 
sleep problems (p < .001), and burnout (p < .001). Confidence in addressing 
workplace aggression buffered homecare workers against negative work and health 
outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: To ensure homecare worker safety and positive health outcomes in 
the provision of services, it is critical to develop and implement preventive 
safety training programs with policies and procedures that support homecare 
workers who experience harassment and violence.

"Not easy at all but I am trying": barriers and facilitators to physical 
activity in a South African cohort of people living with HIV participating in a 
home-based pedometer walking programme.

Sciences , University of the Witwatersrand , Johannesburg , Republic of South 
Africa.

The promotion of physical activity is encouraged in people living with HIV and 
AIDS (PLWHA) as a means of promoting wellness and health. Adherence to 
programmes that promote exercise is often reduced, and home-based programmes are 
suggested to improve adherence. This study investigated the personal and 
environmental factors that cause barriers and facilitators of physical activity 
in a home-based pedometer walking programme as a means of highlighting adherence 
challenges. An observational study nested in a randomised controlled trial was 
conducted in a cohort of South African PLWHA on antiretroviral therapy over a 
six-month period. Descriptive analysis and qualitative content analysis of 42 
participants who underwent physical activity modification assisted with data 
review. The mean age of the sample was 38.7 (±8.9) years, consisted mostly of 
women (n = 35; 83.3%) who were employed (n = 19; 45.2%) but earning very little 
(less than R500 per month) and often single or widowed (n = 23; 54.8%). Barriers 
to physical activity identified included physical complaints, e.g., low-energy 
levels; psychological complaints, e.g., stress levels; family responsibility, 
e.g., being primary caregivers; the physical environment, e.g., adverse weather 
conditions; social environment, e.g., domestic abuse and crime; and workplace, 
e.g., being in a sedentary job. Facilitators of physical activity included 
support and encouragement from friends and family, religious practices during 
worship and community environment, e.g., having access to parks and sport 
fields. The study is of benefit as it highlights personal and environmental 
factors that need to be considered when developing or implementing a home-based 
walking programme in PLWHA.

Nursing students' perceptions of their clinical learning environment in 
placements outside traditional hospital settings.

Bjørk IT(1), Berntsen K, Brynildsen G, Hestetun M.

Author information:
(1)Department of Nursing Science, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore students' opinions of the learning environment 
during clinical placement in settings outside traditional hospital settings.
BACKGROUND: Clinical placement experiences may influence positively on nursing 
students attitudes towards the clinical setting in question. Most studies 
exploring the quality of clinical placements have targeted students' experience 
in hospital settings. The number of studies exploring students' experiences of 
the learning environment in healthcare settings outside of the hospital venue 
does not match the growing importance of such settings in the delivery of health 
care, nor the growing number of nurses needed in these venues.
DESIGN: A survey design was used.
METHOD: The Clinical Learning Environment Inventory was administered to two 
cohorts of undergraduate nursing students (n = 184) after clinical placement in 
mental health care, home care and nursing home care.
RESULTS: Nursing students' overall contentment with the learning environment was 
quite similar across all three placement areas. Students in mental health care 
had significantly higher scores on the subscale individualisation, and older 
students had significantly higher scores on the total scale. Compared with other 
studies where the Clinical Learning Environment Inventory has been used, the 
students' total scores in this study are similar or higher than scores in 
studies including students from hospital settings.
CONCLUSION: Results from this study negate the negative views on clinical 
placements outside the hospital setting, especially those related to placements 
in nursing homes and mental healthcare settings.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Students' experience of the learning environment 
during placements in mental health care, home care and nursing homes indicates 
the relevance of clinical education in settings outside the hospital setting.

Wounds represent a growing healthcare problem due to an aging population. Nurses 
play a key role in wound management and their theoretical understanding of basic 
wound management may be expected to influence the quality of wound therapy 
fundamentally. In this study, we evaluated the level of knowledge of wound 
management in 136 Danish nurses working in 3 different settings: advanced wound 
care clinics, home care and general hospital departments. We found that hospital 
nurses had less theoretical knowledge than home care nurses and nurses working 
at advanced wound care clinics. We also found that the length of experience 
(adjusted for workplace and education) did not have any impact on nurses' 
knowledge. Nurses' knowledge of clinical investigations was consistently lower 
than their knowledge of therapy and clinical symptoms. This study provides 
benchmarking information about the current status of wound management in Denmark 
and suggests how improvements might be achieved.

Characterizing the nature of home care work and occupational hazards: a 
developmental intervention study.

Author information:
(1)Department of Work Environment, University of Massachusetts Lowell, Lowell, 
Massachusetts.

BACKGROUND: Home care (HC) aide is the fastest growing occupation, yet job 
hazards are under-studied. This study documents the context of HC aide work, 
characterizes occupational safety and health (OSH) hazards, and identifies 
preventive interventions using qualitative methods.
METHODS: We conducted 12 focus groups among aides and 26 in-depth interviews 
comprising 15 HC agency, union, and insurance company representatives as well as 
11 HC recipients in Massachusetts. All focus groups and interviews were 
audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded with NVIVO software.
RESULTS: Major OSH concerns were musculoskeletal disorders from client care 
tasks and verbal abuse. Performing tasks beyond specified job duties may be an 
OSH risk factor. HC aides' safety and clients' safety are closely linked. Client 
handling devices, client evaluation, care plan development, and training are key 
interventions for both aides' and clients' safety.
CONCLUSIONS: Promoting OSH in HC is essential for maintaining a viable 
workforce.

The importance of leadership style and psychosocial work environment to 
staff-assessed quality of care: implications for home help services.

Westerberg K(1), Tafvelin S.

Author information:
(1)Department of Psychology, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden.

Work in home help services is typically conducted by an assistant nurse or 
nursing aide in the home of an elderly person, and working conditions have been 
described as solitary with a high workload, little influence and lack of peer 
and leader support. Relations between leadership styles, psychosocial work 
environment and a number of positive and negative employee outcomes have been 
established in research, but the outcome in terms of quality of care has been 
addressed to a lesser extent. In the present study, we aimed to focus on working 
conditions in terms of leadership and the employee psychosocial work 
environment, and how these conditions are related to the quality of care. The 
hypothesis was that the relation between a transformational leadership style and 
quality of care is mediated through organisational and peer support, job control 
and workload. A cross-sectional survey design was used and a total of 469 
questionnaires were distributed (March-April 2012) to assistant nurses in nine 
Swedish home help organisations, including six municipalities and one private 
organisation, representing both rural and urban areas (302 questionnaires were 
returned, yielding a 65% response rate). The results showed that our hypothesis 
was supported and, when indirect effects were also taken into consideration, 
there was no direct effect of leadership style on quality of care. The mediated 
model explained 51% of the variance in quality of care. These results indicate 
that leadership style is important not only to employee outcomes in home help 
services but is also indirectly related to quality of care as assessed by staff 
members.

Exploring workplace violence among home care workers in a consumer-driven home 
health care program.

Nakaishi L, Moss H, Weinstein M, Perrin N, Rose L, Anger WK, Hanson GC, 
Christian M, Glass N.

Nominal research has examined sexual harassment and workplace violence against 
home care workers within consumer-driven home care models such as those offered 
in Oregon. This study examined home care workers' experiences of violence while 
providing care to consumer employers, the patients who hire and manage home care 
workers. Focus groups and interviews were conducted in Oregon with 83 home care 
workers, 99 Oregon Department of Human Services (DHS) employees, and 11 consumer 
employers. Home care workers reported incidents of workplace physical violence 
(44%), psychological abuse (65%), sexual harassment (41%), and sexual violence 
(14%). Further, three themes were identified that may increase the risk of 
workplace violence: (1) real and perceived barriers to reporting violence; (2) 
tolerance of violence; and (3) limited training to prevent violence. To ensure 
worker safety while maintaining quality care, safety policies and training for 
consumer employers, state DHS employees, and home care workers must be 
developed.

'There's a lot of tasks that can be done by any': Findings from an ethnographic 
study into work and organisation in UK community crisis resolution and home 
treatment services.

Hannigan B(1).

Author information:
(1)Cardiff University, UK hanniganb@cardiff.ac.uk.

Across the United Kingdom, large numbers of crisis resolution and home treatment 
services have been established with the aim of providing intensive, short-term 
care to people who would otherwise be admitted to mental health hospital. 
Despite their widespread appearance, little is known about how crisis resolution 
and home treatment services are organised or how crisis work is done. This 
article arises from a larger ethnographic study (in which 34 interviews were 
conducted with practitioners, managers and service users) designed to generate 
data in these and related areas. Underpinned by systems thinking and 
sociological theories of the division of labour, the article examines the 
workplace contributions of mental health professionals and support staff. In a 
fast-moving environment, the work which was done, how and by whom, reflected 
wider professional jurisdictions and a recognisable patterning by organisational 
forces. System characteristics including variable shift-by-shift team 
composition and requirements to undertake assessments of new referrals while 
simultaneously providing home treatment shaped the work of some, but not all, 
professionals. Implications of these findings for larger systems of work are 
considered.

Home care and hospice agencies, bound by regulations, prepare for emergencies 
and disasters by creating policies and protocols for management of emergency 
situations, perhaps conducting table top or other types of drills, and 
discussing hazards likely to impact home care. Is this preparation merely an 
exercise to meet a requirement, or is it life-saving preparation? For one home 
care agency, the emergency exercise saved the day as the scenario enacted in the 
drill was actually lived out a few weeks after the exercise-a scenario the 
agency leaders hoped they would never face. This account explores how the agency 
prepared to meet the emergent situation and details lessons learned in the 
aftermath.

Emotional demands and the risks of depression among homecare workers in the USA.

Kim IH(1), Noh S, Muntaner C.

Author information:
(1)Social and Epidemiological Research, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, 
Toronto, ON, Canada.

PURPOSE: Homecare workers' diversity of emotional demands and their relation to 
mental health problems have not yet been fully explored. The purpose of this 
study is to investigate the types of emotional demands on homecare workers and 
the association of these demands with depression.
METHOD: Data were collected from two surveys of a random sample of 1,599 
homecare workers (June 2003-September 2003 and December 2003-February 2004). 
Depression was assessed using a 20-item RCES-D screening scale.
RESULTS: Homecare workers appeared to have a variety of emotional demands: 
unfair treatment, client's family abuse, unmet care needs, client health, and 
emotional suppression. In general, homecare workers were more likely to be 
exposed to their client health and emotional suppression (mean 
scores = 1.46-3.07) than to be exposed to unmet care needs, unfair treatment, 
and client's family abuse (mean scores = 1.02-1.38). After adjusting for 
potential confounders, four emotional-demand factors (excluding the client 
health factor) were significantly associated with a high risk of subthreshold 
depression at Wave 1. In particular, the factor "unmet care needs" was an 
essential predictor of 6-month subthreshold depression at Wave 2.
CONCLUSION: This study illustrated the diversity of emotional demands among 
homecare workers and their association with depression. Our mixed findings 
regarding the cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses suggested that further 
research should refine the measurement of emotional demands and their 
relationship with mental health among homecare workers.

[Violent experiences and coping among home visiting health care workers in 
Korea].

[Article in Korean]

Lee IS(1), Lee KO, Kang HS, Park YH.

Author information:
(1)School of Nursing, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore violent experiences of home 
visiting health care workers in Korea.
METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional survey. Data were collected using 
self-report questionnaires from 1,640 health care workers. Data collection was 
done between September 1, 2009 and June 30, 2010.
RESULTS: Of the respondents, 70.6% had experienced work-related violence. 
Shouting (51.9%) was the most common verbal violence, followed by verbalizing 
sexual remarks to the health care workers (19.0%) and touching the hands 
(16.5%), the most common acts relating to sexual harassment. Of the respondents 
who had experienced violence, 50.9% told their peers about the incidents. 
However, the major reasons why they did not report these incidents was due to 
the fact that they felt it was useless to file reports and that they expected 
such incidents to occur as part of their job. The majority of the respondents 
(86.4%) wanted education on how to deal with such violence at work.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that efforts should be made to 
increase awareness and to minimize violence in the workplace. Also, educational 
programs should be designed to improve knowledge and to prevent workplace 
violence.

Workforce implications of injury among home health workers: evidence from the 
National Home Health Aide Survey.

PURPOSE OF STUDY:  The direct care workforce continues to rank as one of the 
most frequently injured employee groups in North America. Occupational health 
and safety studies have shown that workplace injuries translate into negative 
outcomes for workers and their employers. The National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Organization of Work and Occupational 
Safety and Health framework is used to examine (a) relationships between 
injuries and work outcomes as reported by home health aides (HHAs) and (b) the 
likely efficacy of employee training and supervisor support in reducing worker 
risk for injury. 
DESIGN AND METHODS:  Data for this analysis were drawn from the 2007 National 
Home Health Aide Survey, a nationally representative survey. Ordinary least 
squares regression and multinomial logistic regression were used to examine 
relationships between worker injury and (a) worker outcomes and (b) 
organizational outcomes and to examine ratings of training and supervisory 
support relative to risk of injury. 
RESULTS:  Injured aides had lower job satisfaction, higher turnover intent, and 
poor employment and care quality perceptions. HHA perceptions of poor training 
and poor supervisory support were significantly related to higher risk for 
workplace injuries. 
IMPLICATIONS:  The current study suggests that workplace training has an 
important role in helping reduce direct care worker injuries, thereby decreasing 
organizational expenses related to injury, such as workers' compensation, sick 
time, and turnover. The NIOSH Organization of Work and Occupational Safety and 
Health framework offers a mechanism by which occupational health and safety 
interventions may be derived to reduce incidents of injury.

The study consisted of a cross sectional sample of 178 Filipino home care 
workers who completed the Paykel Suicide Scale and the Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9. Respondents also completed questionnaires about exposure to 
abuse and perceived social support. Overall, 35% of the sample reported exposure 
to some type of abuse within their home/work environment. For those reporting 
low levels of satisfaction with care recipient, higher exposure to major 
lifetime discrimination was associated with higher SIA, whereas for those 
reporting high levels of satisfaction with care recipient, there was no 
relationship between exposure to major lifetime discrimination and SIA. Abuse 
within the home/work environment was the only predictor of depressive symptoms, 
with greater abuse being associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms. 
Filipino home care workers in Israel likely are exposed to moderate levels of 
abuse and discrimination within the home/work environment as well as within 
society at large. Because live-in home care workers spend the majority of their 
time within the home/work environment, their relationship with their care 
recipients have protective qualities that can serve as a buffer against 
discrimination. Nevertheless, abusive working conditions within their home/work 
environment have detrimental effects on their mental health.

Systematic review of home physiotherapy after hip fracture surgery.

Mehta SP(1), Roy JS.

Author information:
(1)School of Rehabilitation Science, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, 
Canada. mehtas8@mcmaster.ca

OBJECTIVE: To compare the benefits of home physiotherapy, institution-based 
physiotherapy and no physiotherapy following hip fracture surgery.
DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
METHODS: Two reviewers independently extracted data from 5 included studies. 
Standardized mean differences were pooled for health-related quality of life and 
performance-based outcomes. Review Manager Version 5 was used for data analysis.
RESULTS: Analysis of the 5 included studies indicated that home physiotherapy 
was better than no physiotherapy and similar to outpatient physiotherapy in 
improving patient-reported health-related quality of life. Performance-based 
outcomes were marginally better following outpatient physiotherapy compared with 
home physiotherapy 3 and 6 months after surgery. The risk of bias was high for 
most outcomes due to methodological issues in the included studies.
DISCUSSION: There was a trend of better results with increasing intensity of 
physiotherapy intervention, but this did not convert into significant effect 
sizes. The results of this review do not build a strong consensus for 
recommending one mode of physiotherapy over the others. The quality of evidence 
was low mainly due to the high risk of bias in the included studies.
CONCLUSION: In light of no strong consensus, physiotherapists should continue to 
follow their current workplace practice policies for determining suitable 
discharge settings.

BACKGROUND: Due to the decrease in informal care by family members and the 
demographic development, the importance of professional geriatric care will rise 
considerably. Aim of this study was to investigate the psychosocial workplace 
situation for employees in this profession.
METHODS: The German version of the COPSOQ (Copenhagen Psychosocial 
Questionnaire) was used for the assessment of psychosocial factors at work. The 
instrument includes 22 scales and 3 single items concerning demands, control, 
stress, support, and strain.Results between two study groups of geriatric care 
were compared to each other as well as to employees in general hospital care and 
a general population mean (COPSOQ database).Statistical analysis included 
t-tests, ANOVA and multiple comparisons of means. Statistical significance (p < 
0.01, two-tailed) and a difference of at least 5 points in mean values were 
defined as the relevant threshold.
RESULTS: In total 889 respondents from 36 institutions took part in the study. 
412 worked in Home Care (HC), 313 in Geriatric Nursing Homes (GNH), 164 in other 
professions (e.g. administration).Comparison between HC and GNH showed more 
favourable values for the first group for the most scales, e.g. lower 
quantitative and emotional demands and less work-privacy conflict, better 
possibilities for development etc. Compared to external values from the German 
COPSOQ database for general hospital care (N = 1.195) and the total mean across 
all professions, COPSOQ-total (N = 11.168), the results are again positive for 
HC workers on most of the scales concerning demands and social support. The only 
negative finding is the very low amount of social relations at work due to the 
obligation to work alone most of the time. Employees in GNH rate predictability, 
quality of leadership and feedback higher when compared to general hospital care 
and show some further favourable mean values compared to the COPSOQ mean value 
for all professions. A disadvantage for GNH is the high rating for job 
insecurity.A supplementary subgroup analysis showed that the degree of negative 
evaluation of psychosocial factors concerning demands was related to the amount 
of working hours per week and the number of on-call duties.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to employees in general hospital care and the COPSOQ 
overall mean value across all professions, geriatric care employees and 
especially home care workers evaluate their psychosocial working situation more 
positive for most aspects. However, this seems partly due to the very high 
proportion of part-time workers. Critical results for the two study groups are 
the relatively high job insecurity in nursing homes and the lack of social 
relations for the HCrs.

The objective of this study was to develop and test measures for assessing risk 
of violence toward staff during home visits. Home visiting health workers from 
public and private home visiting programs in a Mid-Atlantic state (n = 130) were 
surveyed to assess exposure to risky home visits, verbal and physical violence, 
and workplace violence safety climate. Two measures demonstrated evidence of 
reliability and validity moving the safety research closer to developing tools 
and processes for protecting home care clinicians.

Provision and use of safety-engineered medical devices among home care 
and hospice nurses in North Carolina.

Leiss JK(1).

Communities, Mebane, NC 27302, USA. jackl@mcmoss.org

BACKGROUND: Nurses who provide care in the home are at risk of blood exposure 
from needlesticks. Using safety-engineered medical devices reduces the risk of 
needlestick. The objectives of this study were to assess provision of safety 
devices by home care and hospice agencies as well as the use of these devices by 
home care and hospice nurses in North Carolina, and to examine the association 
between provision and use.
METHODS: A mail survey was conducted among North Carolina home care and hospice 
nurses in 2006.
RESULTS: The adjusted response rate was 69% (n = 833). The percentage of nurses 
who were always provided with safety devices ranged from 51% (blood tube 
holders) to 83% (winged steel needles). Ninety-five percent of nurses who were 
always provided with safety devices, but only 15%-50% of nurses who were not 
always provided with safety devices, used a safety device the last time they 
used that general type of device. Among nurses who did not use a safety device 
on that occasion, 60%-80% did not use it because it was not provided by the 
agency.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that limited access is the primary reason for 
home care/hospice nurses' failure to use safety devices. The policy goal of 
providing safety devices to health care workers in all situations in which such 
devices could reduce their risk of needlestick is not being achieved for home 
care nurses in North Carolina.

Workplace violence, defined as violent acts directed toward workers, includes 
physical assault, threat of assault, and verbal abuse and is widely recognized 
as a threat to workers' health and safety. Healthcare workers, especially 
nurses, are known to be at high risk. As employees who work alone, have access 
to drugs, provide care to people in distress, and/or have frequent close contact 
with clients, they face a greater likelihood of exposure to violence. Nurses' 
risk has been correlated with degree of patient contact; the odds of physical 
violence are 7.2 and 9.0 times greater for healthcare workers with moderate and 
high patient contact, respectively, compared with those with little or no 
contact.

Differences between day and nonday workers in exposure to physical and 
psychosocial work factors in the Danish eldercare sector.

Author information:
(1)The National Research Centre for the Working Environment, Lersø Parkallé 105, 
DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark. knn@nrcwe.dk

OBJECTIVE: The possible interaction between individual and occupational risk 
factors, the need for meaningful intervention, and the demand for valid shift 
work research make the accumulation of adverse exposures at certain times of the 
day of special relevance with respect to occupational health. The aim of the 
present study was therefore to examine whether there was a clustering of 
detrimental work factors among female eldercare workers in fixed evening or 
fixed night shifts when they are compared with workers in fixed day shifts.
METHODS: This cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was conducted among 
4590 female health care workers in the Danish eldercare sector. The participants 
worked in nursing homes, in home care, or in both. They answered questions on 
job demands, job control, and social support, together with questions on 
physical and psychological violence, physical workload, and passive smoking.
RESULTS: We found that-compared with day workers-fixed nonday workers were more 
exposed to low job control, low support from leaders, physical and psychological 
violence, and high physical demands. Nonday workers were, however, less exposed 
to high demands. These differences remained after control for age, job title, 
and workplace.
CONCLUSIONS: Exposures in the work environment of Danish eldercare workers 
varied between shifts. In a research perspective these findings stress the 
importance of adequate adjustment for work factors when the health effects of 
shift work are studied. Moreover, the results underscore the need for an 
increased awareness of work factors of special importance among nonday workers 
when interventions against shiftwork-related occupational disorders are 
designed.

Workplace danger and violence are complex problems that affect nurses more often 
than is recognized. The home healthcare work environment is challenging enough 
without the additional risks associated with working out in the open or within a 
client's home. Every clinician working in home health today understands the 
demands of visits or extended care in the home and often reluctantly accepts the 
involved risk. The clinician working in the rural setting may experience similar 
challenges, but in large metropolitan cities, it has become increasingly 
frightening as crime, drug use, gangs, violence, homelessness, and 
transportation issues have made the clinician's job much tougher. It is 
important to renew awareness and remind clinicians to maintain constant 
vigilance for personal safety.

eija.gronroos@metropolia.fi

AIM: This paper is a report of a study to investigate the self-reported 
competence of home nursing staff and whether this is associated with their 
education, job descriptions, access to help and support and with factors in 
their psychosocial work environment, such as opportunities for personal growth 
and development at work.
BACKGROUND: Home nursing staff face increasing demands on their competence. 
Advances in information technology and working methods have increased the need 
for education. Thus, information on the factors associated with the competence 
of home nursing staff help us to support them in a way that improves the quality 
of care.
METHOD: The data were gathered via a questionnaire completed in 2003 by the home 
nursing staff of 24 municipalities in different regions of Finland. A total of 
2366 home care staff (response rate 63%), of whom 790 were home nursing staff 
(response rate 65%), were sent questionnaires. Univariate and multivariate 
logistic regression were used as main statistical methods.
FINDINGS: The best predictors for self-reported competence of home nursing staff 
were their reading scientific or professional journals, opportunities for skill 
development, decision-making latitude and work demands.
CONCLUSION: Simple and practical ways for updating the competence of home 
nursing staff should be created. These staff are a very important source of 
information for home care clients. Supporting the knowledge of home nursing 
staff is also an efficient way of keeping clients and their informal caregivers 
informed about care guidelines, health and social services and social benefits.

An evaluation of an aggression management training program to cope with 
workplace violence in the healthcare sector.

1738, DR Rotterdam 3000, The Netherlands.

Workplace violence is a major occupational hazard for healthcare workers, 
generating a need for effective intervention programs. The purpose of this study 
was to evaluate the effectiveness of an aggression management training program. 
The evaluation design was based on the internal referencing strategy, an 
unobtrusive and applicable evaluation method that rules out some major threats 
to internal validity without the need for a control group. On three occasions, 
training participants completed a questionnaire containing experimental and 
control variables. As hypothesized, there was a significant improvement in the 
experimental variables that was larger than the non-significant change in the 
control variable. We conclude that aggression management training may be an 
effective instrument in the fight against workplace violence.

Nursing staff competence, work strain, stress and satisfaction in elderly care: 
a comparison of home-based care and nursing homes.

Hasson H(1), Arnetz JE.

Author information:

Sweden . henna.hasson@pubcare.uu.se

AIMS: The aims of this study were to: (1) compare older people care nursing 
staff's perceptions of their competence, work strain and work satisfaction in 
nursing homes and home-based care; and (2) to examine determinants of work 
satisfaction in both care settings.
BACKGROUND: The shift in older people care from hospitals to community-based 
facilities and home care has had implications for nursing practice. Lack of 
competence development, high levels of work strain and low levels of work 
satisfaction among nursing staff in both care settings have been associated with 
high turnover. Few studies have compared staff perceptions of their competence 
and work in nursing homes as opposed to home-based care.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey.
METHODS: Nursing staff perceptions of their competence, work strain, stress and 
satisfaction were measured by questionnaire in 2003 in two older people care 
organizations in Sweden. Comparisons of all outcome variables were made between 
care settings both within and between the two organizations. Multiple regression 
analysis was used to determine predictors of work satisfaction in home care and 
nursing homes respectively.
RESULTS: In general, staff in home-based care reported significantly less 
sufficient knowledge compared with staff in nursing homes. However, home care 
staff experienced significantly less physical and emotional strain compared with 
staff in nursing homes. Ratings of work-related exhaustion, mental energy and 
overall work satisfaction did not differ significantly between care settings. In 
both care settings, work-related exhaustion was the strongest (inverse) 
predictor of work satisfaction.
CONCLUSIONS: Future interventions should focus on counteracting work-related 
exhaustion and improving competence development to improve work satisfaction 
among older people care nursing staff in both care settings. Relevance to 
clinical practice. Work-related exhaustion and lack of competence development 
may have significant negative implications for work satisfaction among older 
people care nursing staff in both home care and nursing homes.

Evaluation of an educational "toolbox" for improving nursing staff competence 
and psychosocial work environment in elderly care: results of a prospective, 
non-randomized controlled intervention.

Arnetz JE(1), Hasson H.

BACKGROUND: Lack of professional development opportunities among nursing staff 
is a major concern in elderly care and has been associated with work 
dissatisfaction and staff turnover. There is a lack of prospective, controlled 
studies evaluating the effects of educational interventions on nursing 
competence and work satisfaction.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible effects of an 
educational "toolbox" intervention on nursing staff ratings of their competence, 
psychosocial work environment and overall work satisfaction.
DESIGN: The study was a prospective, non-randomized, controlled intervention.
PARTICIPANTS AND SETTINGS: Nursing staff in two municipal elderly care 
organizations in western Sweden.
METHODS: In an initial questionnaire survey, nursing staff in the intervention 
municipality described several areas in which they felt a need for competence 
development. Measurement instruments and educational materials for improving 
staff knowledge and work practices were then collated by researchers and 
managers in a "toolbox." Nursing staff ratings of their competence and work were 
measured pre and post-intervention by questionnaire. Staff ratings in the 
intervention municipality were compared to staff ratings in the reference 
municipality, where no toolbox was introduced.
RESULTS: Nursing staff ratings of their competence and psychosocial work 
environment, including overall work satisfaction, improved significantly over 
time in the intervention municipality, compared to the reference group. Both 
competence and work environment ratings were largely unchanged among reference 
municipality staff. Multivariate analysis revealed a significant interaction 
effect between municipalities over time for nursing staff ratings of 
participation, leadership, performance feedback and skills' development. Staff 
ratings for these four scales improved significantly in the intervention 
municipality as compared to the reference municipality.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to a reference municipality, nursing staff ratings of 
their competence and the psychosocial work environment improved in the 
municipality where the toolbox was introduced.

mas@uwindsor.ca

This study of Canadian community health nurses (N = 1,044) compared the 
work-related concerns, job satisfaction, and factors influencing the retention 
of public health, home care, and community care access center (CCAC) nurses. 
Community health nurses identified similar work-related issues as being of 
greatest concern to them, but there were significant differences among the 3 
groups of nurses in the magnitude of these concerns. There were also significant 
differences among the 3 groups for satisfaction with their jobs and their 
immediate supervisors, with CCAC nurses being the least satisfied except for the 
greater dissatisfaction of home care nurses with their pay and benefits. For the 
retention factors, the differences were primarily in the areas of job features 
and supportive work relationships. There are both similarities and differences 
among public health, home care, and CCAC nurses. Initiatives to address 
community health nurses' concerns, improve their job satisfaction, and increase 
their retention will require interventions tailored to the specific community 
health care setting.

The impact of manual handling training on work place injuries: a 14 year audit.

Massy-Westropp M(1), Rose D.

Author information:
(1)Metropolitan Domiciliary Care Southern Region, Adelaide, SA, Australia.

Manual handling injuries represented both the highest costs and largest 
proportion of workers compensation claims for the South Australian Department of 
Human Services from 1995 to 1999 (Risk Management Services 2000). There is 
evidence to suggest the manutention method of manual handling training can 
reduce workplace injuries. A retrospective audit of injuries was conducted at 
Metropolitan Domiciliary Care Southern Region, a community health service 
agency, to determine the effects of introducing the manutention method of manual 
handling to the agency. The workers most likely to sustain a manual handling 
injury were paramedical aides. For this workgroup, the incidence and severity of 
injuries were significantly reduced for the period following the introduction of 
the manutention method of manual handling training.

Data from 188 home health employees revealed that working for a reputable 
agency, having adequate business/office support, and interactions with patients 
were positively associated with job satisfaction. New employees viewed positive 
relationships with supervisors as an important indicator of job satisfaction, 
whereas senior employees reported recognition/acknowledgment to relate more with 
job satisfaction. Reduced workload, improved work environment, and frequent 
meetings were viewed as critical elements of quality care provision and 
coordination. Practice improvements are highlighted.

Evaluation of safety training for manual handling of people with disabilities in 
specialised group homes in Australia.

Ore T(1).

Author information:
(1)timothy.ore@justice.vic.gov.au

OBJECTIVE: This paper attempted to examine the question of whether 351 
disability services workers in an Australian State Government agency given 
manual handling training had significantly lower injury rates from manual 
handling injuries a year post-training than a control group (n = 351) without 
the training.
METHODS: Control group members were selected by stratified random sampling to 
closely match the intervention group. The measures employed were the number of 
reported manual handling injuries per 100 full-time equivalents by certain 
characteristics, frequency of incidents, mean workers' compensation cost, and 
mean compensated days.
RESULTS: Training in manual handling methods significantly reduced the risk by 
as much as 42%, with an average rate of 49.6 per 100 full-time equivalents (95% 
confidence interval 44.4-55.0) among the intervention group compared with 84.8 
per 100 full-time equivalents (95% confidence interval 76.0-94.1) among 
controls. The risk differential was consistent across gender, age group, length 
of service, and job classification. However, in two injury categories (client 
lift/transfer and general manual handling), the intervention group had a 
marginally higher risk. The average workers' compensation cost in the control 
group was 4.2 times that in the intervention group.
CONCLUSION: While the study has some weaknesses, overall, there is little 
evidence to suggest that the outcome observed was due to threats to internal 
validity. It is expected that the findings can encourage further evaluation 
studies of workplace safety training programs.

Moral stress: synthesis of a concept.

The aim of this article is to describe the synthesis of the concept of moral 
stress and to attempt to identify its preconditions. Qualitative data from two 
independent studies on professional issues in nursing were analysed from a 
hypothetical-deductive approach. The findings indicate that moral stress is 
independent of context-given specific preconditions: (1) nurses are morally 
sensitive to the patient's vulnerability; (2) nurses experience external factors 
preventing them from doing what is best for the patient; and (3) nurses feel 
that they have no control over the specific situation. The findings from this 
analysis are supported by recent research on stress in the workplace but differ 
that the imperatives directing work are moral in nature. Stress researchers have 
found that persons who experience that they have no control over their work 
situation and at the same time experience high demands may be prone to 
cardiovascular diseases. An important question raised by this study is whether 
moral stress should be recognized as a health risk in nursing. Further research 
is required in order to generate intervention models to prevent or deal with 
moral stress.

Making the right connection: matching patients to technology.

Although technology has sometimes been the cause of rising healthcare costs, 
telemedicine technology has been proposed as a means to increase productivity in 
the workplace and reduce resource utilization for high-risk populations. The 
Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in April of 2000, implemented an expansive 
telemedicine technology initiative in its Sunshine Network, covering veterans in 
south Georgia, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands through the 
Community Care Coordination Service (CCCS). The initiative uses home telehealth 
technology to support veteran healthcare. Choosing appropriate tools to enhance 
care coordination and matching technology to specific patient needs was vital to 
the success of the CCCS model. A technology algorithm was developed across the 
Network initiative and grew out of a need to identify and benchmark best 
practices. An evaluation methodology developed by a health economist and his 
research team at the University of Maryland was used to determine patient 
satisfaction with technology and functional status through a validated 
instrument. Outcomes were for 791 chronic medical and 120 mental health 
patients. Patient satisfaction was extremely high, patients used technology 
without difficulty and acceptance was greater than expected. Patients' 
perception of health as surveyed with the functional status instrument showed 
improved perception in many factors including pain, physical, and social 
functioning.

Scared to go to work: a home care performance improvement initiative.

The incident report read. "His arm was tightly locked around my neck. His free 
arm was touching me while he said terrible, obscene things he intended to do. My 
heart was pounding. My mind was racing, unable to think rationally. I needed to 
focus on an escape plan. I was too terrified to think. I just aimlessly 
struggled. It seemed like an eternity, then, somehow I broke loose." Reading the 
words on the incident report was horrible. But, nothing compared to seeing the 
young nurse's eyes, as she stood, barely able to speak, in the office doorway of 
her manager. There was no doubt that immediate intervention was needed to 
improve safety at our home health agency.

The political and social response to September 11 has required home health 
employers to address new and sometimes unfamiliar personnel matters. Home care 
employers must be mindful of certain legal obligations, some imposed quite 
recently, designed to protect the rights of employees both on the job and if 
called away to duty.

Behind closed doors: in-home workers' experience of sexual harassment and 
workplace violence.

The authors developed and tested a structural model predicting personal and 
organizational consequences of workplace violence and sexual harassment for 
health care professionals who work inside their client's home. The model 
suggests that workplace violence and sexual harassment predict fear of their 
recurrence in the workplace, which in turn predicts negative mood (anxiety and 
anger) and perceptions of injustice. In turn, fear, negative mood, and perceived 
injustice predict lower affective commitment and enhanced withdrawal intentions, 
poor interpersonal job performance, greater neglect, and cognitive difficulties. 
The results supported the model and showed that the associations of workplace 
violence and sexual harassment with organizational and personal outcomes are 
indirect, mediated by fear and negative mood. Conceptual implications for 
understanding sexual harassment and workplace violence, and future research 
directions, are suggested.

Close calls for low-back injuries.

Cheung K(1).

Back injuries are a major hazard in the workplace, particularly in the nursing 
profession. In acute care in Alberta, nursing personnel account for almost 50 
per cent of all lost-time claims per year. In extended care facilities, nursing 
personnel account for 60 per cent of lost-time claims. The source of injury is 
often another person (64%), the incident is often lifting or over-exertion 
(65%), and the injury is most often a sprain or strain (75%). Furthermore, 50 
per cent of lost-time injuries are to the back. Clearly, back strains while 
handling clients are a major hazard in the health care industry.

A safe and healthy work environment.

Thobaben M.

Home health and hospice employers must be continually diligent in their efforts 
to prevent work-related injuries and illnesses. They have a legal and 
professional responsibility to provide employees with a workplace that is free 
from recognized hazards that cause or are likely to cause serious physical 
injury or death, and to maintain working conditions that are safe and healthful 
for their employees. This article reviews laws that affect work-related safety 
and illness. It provides guidelines for agency prevention programs regarding 
employee protection against workplace violence and infectious disease. A safe 
and healthy workplace is essential for home health and hospice employees to 
provide quality client care and for agencies to be protected from potential 
liability.

Recent court decisions and public scandals have brought sexual harassment to the 
forefront of workplace issues. Home care employers may face legal liability if 
they do not establish firm guidelines prohibiting sexual harassment and train 
employees to recognize and avoid this problem.
