The visual load of drivers can be used to evaluate driving safety and comfort. To reveal drivers’ visual load characteristics at the entrance and exit of extra-long tunnels on mountainous expressways, this study conducted vehicle tests with 12 drivers at Gonghe extra-long tunnel on the Yu-Xiang expressway in the Wulong District. An eye tracker, non-contact multifunctional velocimetry, illuminometer, and other test equipment were used to record drivers’ pupil areas, velocity, and illuminance when entering and leaving the tunnel. The change characteristics of drivers’ pupil areas were studied. The maximum transient velocity value (MTPA) of the pupil area was selected as an index to evaluate the visual load degree. Based on velocity and illuminance coupling, a visual load model was constructed using the optimized support vector machine (GA-SVM). The influence of velocity and illuminance on the MTPA in the tunnel’s approach, entrance, exit, and departure section was analyzed. The results show that drivers’ psychological tension order at the entrance and exit is entrance section ≈ exit section > departure section > approach section. In the approach section, the visual load is mainly affected by environmental illumination. In the entrance and exit sections, the visual load is positively correlated with velocity and negatively correlated with illuminance, and velocity has a greater impact on visual load. In the tunnel departure section, the two variables synergistically influence the driving visual load. The research results provide theoretical support for the safety design and management of extra-long tunnel entrances and exits.\n']",academic:abstract,plos_scrapper.py,construction,20220928T101606,(abstract:construction) AND (injury OR safety OR health OR accident OR stress OR risk OR ohs) NOT (abstract:protein)

Based on the particularity of the vehicle system and the complexity of the system, the hierarchical analysis method (AHP) is used to evaluate its safety. High-order judgment matrix often has inconsistency, and the judgment matrix consistency guarantee is the key to the hierarchical analysis method applied. Based on the hierarchical analysis principle, this paper corrects the inconsistency judgment matrix and realizes the optimization calculation based on the genetic algorithm. This paper constructs a vehicle system safety evaluation index system including 26 indexes at three layers and uses the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to evaluate the system safety level. The results show that the calculation results based on the improved AHP-GA are significantly better than that based on the conventional AHP method. The comprehensive evaluation conclusion of the case is ""average"", and the safety level of the vehicle system of the case enterprise needs to be strengthened.\n']",academic:abstract,plos_scrapper.py,construction,20220928T101606,(abstract:construction) AND (injury OR safety OR health OR accident OR stress OR risk OR ohs) NOT (abstract:protein)

This study aimed to examine if spirituality modifies the relationship between types of rumination and trauma outcomes. Ninety-six students completed an online survey of four questionnaires in a cross-sectional online survey: The Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale, the Event Related Rumination Inventory, the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory-Short form and the Expressions of Spirituality Inventory- Revised. Findings revealed that spirituality was related to DR and PTG, but not to IR or PTSD symptoms. Moderation analysis showed that spirituality significantly moderated the relationship between PTG and DR, but not the relationship between PTSD and IR. These findings indicate that while spirituality has no relationship with negative outcomes of trauma, it may help individuals to ruminate in a constructive manner in order to develop positive outcomes.\n']",academic:abstract,plos_scrapper.py,construction,20220928T101606,(abstract:construction) AND (injury OR safety OR health OR accident OR stress OR risk OR ohs) NOT (abstract:protein)

Methods: Injured workers identified in Michigan’s Workers’ Compensation records from 2016 to 2018 were linked to the opioid prescription history in the Michigan Automated Prescription System. Results: Among the 46,934 injured workers with paid claims, the prevalence of receiving an opioid prescription, morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per prescription, number of opioid prescription and probability of receiving opioids prescription>90 days after injury decreased from 2016–2018. Despite the decrease over 50% of the injured workers received an opioid prescription. Being over 34 years, a male, having had an opioid prescription before the injury, working in construction or having an amputation or sprain/strain of the shoulder had a significantly higher probability of receiving an opioid prescription, a higher MME per prescription, a higher number of opioid prescriptions and a higher probability having opioids prescription >90 days after the injury. Conclusions: Even though opioid prescribing patterns generally decreased from 2016 to 2018 (64.5–52.8%), injured workers in Michigan had a higher prevalence of opioid prescription after injury, than those reported from other states.

Increasing levels of habitual PA may be more feasible and result in greater compliance than conventional exercise training inventions which give little or no attention to long-term PA behaviour. Despite this there is limited research exploring perceptions of PA among adults with CF. The study aimed to understand the ecological correlates of PA in adults with CF and to involve individuals with CF, their families (where applicable) and clinicians in a formative process to inform the development of an ecological approach to PA promotion in this population. Methods: An iterative approach was utilised, whereby findings from earlier phases of the research informed subsequent phases. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore patients’ perceptions of PA, devised using the PRECEDE component of the PRECEDE-PROCEED model. Followed by, focus groups to discuss the perceived barriers, facilitators and opportunities for PA participation and how this information could inform the development and delivery of a PA intervention. Separate focus groups were conducted with individuals with CF (n = 11) and their families and CF MDT members. Thematic analysis was used to construct themes. Results: Physical and mental wellbeing manifested as both barriers and facilitators of PA. CF is characterised by a progressive decline in physical function, which presents as a number of challenging symptoms and set-backs for an individual with CF. PA represents an opportunity for participants to slow the rate of this decline and manage the symptoms associated with the condition. Enjoyment was an important facilitator of PA. Exercise professionals and family reinforce PA behaviour, particularly during adolescence. Conclusions: PA promotion should form part of routine CF care with additional exercise professional support during adolescence.

To achieve this goal, a signal extraction approach is used to monitor the evolution of a number of economic indicators that tend to exhibit the abnormal behaviors. 13 economic variables were selected as the individual indicators, and constructed as the four comprehensive indicators. Our empirical work shows that the early warning system for urban housing price crises is suitable for China’s four province-level municipalities. The in-sample forecasting results indicate the reliability of the early warning system for urban housing price crises. By studying the out-of-sample forecasting results, the likelihood of housing price crises for the four cities can be effectively predicted. We construct a novel weighted average comprehensive indicator, which performs better than the three others in terms of overall performance across all of the criteria considered in. It is shown that the extended system is more flexible in decision making than the traditional early warning system.\n']",academic:abstract,plos_scrapper.py,construction,20220928T101606,(abstract:construction) AND (injury OR safety OR health OR accident OR stress OR risk OR ohs) NOT (abstract:protein)

However, physical activity levels in individuals living with HF are typically extremely low. This qualitative study with one-to-one interviews systematically explores perceived clinical, environmental, and psychosocial barriers and enablers in older adults (≥70 years old) living with HF. Semi-structured interviews (N = 16) based on the Theoretical Domains Framework elicited 39 belief statements describing the barriers and enablers to physical activity. Theoretical domains containing these beliefs and corresponding constructs that were both pervasive and common were deemed most relevant. These were: concerns about physical activity (Beliefs about Consequences), self-efficacy (Beliefs about Capabilities), social support (Social Influences), major health event (Environmental Context and Resources), goal behavioural (Goal), action planning (Behavioural Regulation). This work extends the limited research on the modifiable barriers and enablers for physical activity participation by individuals living with HF. The research findings provide insights for cardiologists, HF-specialist nurses, and physiotherapists to help co-design and deliver a physical activity intervention more likely to be effective for individuals living with HF.\n']",academic:abstract,plos_scrapper.py,construction,20220928T101606,(abstract:construction) AND (injury OR safety OR health OR accident OR stress OR risk OR ohs) NOT (abstract:protein)

Progenitor cell chemotaxis towards axially vascularized tissues has not been well characterized. In a prospective randomized controlled study including 32 male syngeneic Lewis rats we investigated the capability of the axially vascularized constructs to attract systemically injected bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs). The underlying mechanism for cell homing was investigated focusing on the role of hypoxia and the SDF1-CXCR4-7 axis. Sixteen animals were used as donors for BMMNCs. The other animals were subjected to implantation of a tissue engineering construct in the subcutaneous groin region. These constructs were axially vascularized either via an arteriovenous loop (AVL, n = 6) or via uninterrupted flow-through vessels (non-AVL, n = 10). BMMNCs were labelled with quantum dots (Qdot® 655) and injected 12 days after surgery either via intra-arterial or intravenous routes. 2 days after cell injection, the animals were sacrificed and examined using fluorescence microscopy. The Qdot® 655 signals were detected exclusively in the liver, spleen, AVL constructs and to a minimal extent in the non-AVL constructs. A significant difference could be detected between the number of labelled cells in the AVL and non-AVL constructs with more cells detected in the AVL constructs specially in central zones (p <0.0001). The immunohistological analysis showed a significant increase in the absolute expression of HIF-1 in the AVL group in comparison to the non-AVL group. The PCR analysis confirmed a 1.4-fold increase in HIF-1 expression in AVL constructs. Although PCR analysis showed an enhanced expression of CXCR4 and CXCR7 in AVL constructs, no significant differences in SDF1 expression were detected via immunohistological or PCR analysis. At the examined time point, the AVL constructs can attract BMMNCs in a mechanism probably related to the hypoxia associated with a robust tissue formation.\n']",academic:abstract,plos_scrapper.py,construction,20220928T101606,(abstract:construction) AND (injury OR safety OR health OR accident OR stress OR risk OR ohs) NOT (abstract:protein)

Hydroxyapatite (HA) coupons, printed using DLP, were evaluated for biological performance in supporting viability, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation of the human cell line U2OS and human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) up to 35 days in culture to determine feasibility for future use in development of complex scaffold geometries. Contact angle, profilometry, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements showed the HA coupons to be hydrophilic, porous, and having micro size surface roughness, all within favourable cell culture ranges. The study found no impact of leachable and extractables form the DLP printing process. Cells seeded on coupons exhibited morphologies comparable to conventional tissue culture polystyrene plates. Cell proliferation rates, as determined by direct cell count and the RealTime-GloTM MT Cell Viability Assay, were similar on HA coupons and standard tissue culture polystyrene plates). Osteogenic differentiation of human MSCs on HA coupons was confirmed using alkaline phosphatase, Alizarin Red S and von Kossa staining. The morphology of MSCs cultured in osteogenic medium for 14 to 35 days was similar on HA coupons and tissue culture polystyrene plates, with osteogenic (geometric, cuboidal morphology with dark nodules) and adipogenic (lipid vesicles and deposits) features. We conclude that the DLP process and LithaBone HA400 slurry are biocompatible and are suitable for osteogenic applications. Coupons served as an effective evaluation design in the characterization and visualization of cell responses on DLP printed HA material.

Four and three screws were used at the cranial (screw 1 to 4) and caudal (screw 5 to 7) segment of the plate. Finite element models of the plate and canine pelvis were created. A load of 300 N was applied on the femur-hip joint contact area. Values of Von Mises Stress on the plate, screws and the maximum and minimum main stresses in the bone were used to capture the mechanical factors in this study. Results: The novel implant had a plate stress of 51.9 megapascals (MPa) with higher stress in the dorsal part of the plate. Screws 2 and 4 showed similar stress values of 17.3 MPa. Screws 1 and 3 were the most loaded (51.9 MPa and 75 MPa, respectively). Screws 5, 6, and 7 showed similar dissipation and stress values (21.55 MPa). There was traction force in the dorsal region of the pubis and compression in the ventral part, with dissipation and values of 15.4 MPa and 23.9 MPa, respectively, acquiring balance between them. Conclusion: The novel plate is potentially applicable and specifically suitable for iliac fractures in dogs.

Over the last few decades, researchers have also applied these concepts to non-human animals. However, there is a lack of uniformity in how the concept of allostasis is described and assessed in animals. The objectives of this review were to: 1) describe the extent to which the concepts of allostasis and allostatic load are applied theoretically to animals, with a focus on which taxa and species are represented; 2) identify when direct assessments of allostasis or allostatic load are made, which species and contexts are represented, what biomarkers are used, and if an allostatic load index was constructed; and 3) detect gaps in the literature and identify areas for future research. A search was conducted using CABI, PubMed, Agricola, and BIOSIS databases, in addition to a complementary hand-search of 14 peer-reviewed journals. Search results were screened, and articles that included non-human animals, as well as the terms “allostasis” or “allostatic” in the full text, were included. A total of 572 articles met the inclusion criteria (108 reviews and 464 peer-reviewed original research). Species were represented across all taxa. A subset of 63 publications made direct assessments of allostatic load. Glucocorticoids were the most commonly used biomarker, and were the only biomarker measured in 25 publications. Only six of 63 publications (9.5%) constructed an allostatic load index, which is the preferred methodology in human research. Although concepts of allostasis and allostatic load are being applied broadly across animal species, most publications use single biomarkers that are more likely indicative of short-term rather than chronic stress. Researchers are encouraged to adopt methodologies used in human research, including the construction of species-specific allostatic load indexes.\n']",academic:abstract,plos_scrapper.py,construction,20220928T101606,(abstract:construction) AND (injury OR safety OR health OR accident OR stress OR risk OR ohs) NOT (abstract:protein)

The grain distribution detected in both model species bioconstructions was analysed using a fractal numerical model (Hausdorff fractal dimension). Collected data show that in both organisms the grains were distributed according to a fractal model, indicating that the evolutionary process may have led to finding the same optimal constructive strategy across organisms with an independent evolutionary history, notwithstanding different geometrical scales. Furthermore, in sectioned tubes we observed microplastic fragments agglutinated within the arenaceous wall and in the inter-tube area.

This study evaluates the factorial structure of the item-reduced version of the Comprehensive General Parenting Questionnaire (CGPQ), which assesses five constructs of general parenting. Methods: The study uses data from two cross-sectional studies: Study 1 in 2014 (n = 173) and Study 2 in 2015–16 (n = 805). Parents of children aged three to six answered the CGPQ; in Study 1 the 69-item version, and in Study 2 the 29-item version. The reduction was based on the results of the confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) in Study 1. In both datasets, internal consistency, as Cronbach’s alphas and intraclass correlations between the items of each construct, was tested. A combined assessment of the CFA and items response theory evaluated the construct validity and the item importance for the 29-item version, and a further the reduced 22-item version. Results: In Study 1, the highest Cronbach’s alphas were shown for the five constructs in the 69-item version. A higher intraclass correlation was found between the constructs in the 69- and 29-item versions, than between the 69- and the 22-item version. However, a high concordance was found between the constructs in the 29- and 22-item versions in both Study 1 and in Study 2 (0.76–1.00). Testing the goodness-of-fit of the CFA models revealed that the 22-item model fulfilled all the criteria, showing that it had a better factorial structure than the 29-item model. Standard estimations ranged from 0.20 to 0.76 in the 22-item version. Conclusion: The reduced 22- and 29-item versions of the 69-item CGPQ showed good model fit, the 22-item version the better of the two. These short versions can be used to assess general parenting without overburdening the respondents.

21,PLOS ONE,2022-08-19T00:00:00Z,Development and psychometric assessment of cutaneous leishmaniasis prevention behaviors questionnaire in adolescent female students: Application of integration of cultural model and extended parallel process model,"['Background: Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) is an important public health issue in at least 83 countries, including Iran. Individuals’ behavior modification is believed to be one of the best ways for CL prevention. However, no comprehensive questionnaires have been psychoanalyzed for identification of CL prevention behaviors and its numerous associated factors, as well as the impact of educational messages. Thus, the present study was conducted to develop and psychometrically assess CL prevention behaviors questionnaire in female students. Methods: The present study was performed from October 2020 to May 2021 by developing a preliminary questionnaire based on integration of Cultural Model and Extended Parallel Process Model. The questionnaire was completed online by 460 adolescent female students living in endemic areas of Isfahan, Iran. Exploratory factor analysis was performed using SPSS 24 to ensure the construct validity. Internal reliability was assessed via Cronbach’s alpha and external reliability was determined using the test-retest method based on the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) index. Results: The first version of the questionnaire contains 110 items, out of which 82 remained according to content validity ratio (CVR) and content validity index (CVI) criteria. Afterwards, 11 items were removed due to low factor load in the construct validity process using the factor analysis technique. Ultimately, a 71-items questionnaire was developed and 12 factors were extracted from it. According to Cronbach’s alpha index, the internal reliability for the questionnaire was 0.877 and the ICC index calculated the external reliability as 0.833. Conclusions: Integration of a Cultural Model with individual model was used for the first time to measure the factors related to CL prevention behaviors in this questionnaire; owing to the strength of the factor structure and appropriate psychometric properties, the questionnaire is applicable in the evaluation process of educational interventions concerning CL prevention, especially in female students.

Social Capital can be developed through offline and online relationships. It can be distinguished between cognitive Social Capital (perception of trustworthiness, reciprocity, and support) and structural Social Capital (density of social networks and membership, and participation in groups and associations). It can also be distinguished between bonding Social Capital (resources associated with informal networks; i.e., neighbors, friends, colleagues) and bridging Social Capital (resources associated with formal networks; i.e., community service, cultural, religious or political groups/associations). The different forms and dimensions of Social Capital may have distinct effects on health outcomes and self-rated health. Therefore, public health researchers need valid and reliable instruments to investigate Social Capital. However, valid instruments including the measurement of online Social Capital are not available. The Personal Social Capital Scale aims to assess bonding and bridging Social Capital by means of cognitive and structural items. In the present investigation, three studies were carried out (N = 1149) to adapt the Personal Social Capital Scale to develop the Personal On-Offline Social Capital Brief Scale, a brief scale for measuring online and offline bonding and bridging Social Capital in Italy. Factorial structure and convergent/divergent validity in relation to scales measuring constructs with different patterns of relationships with bonding and bridging Social Capital (i.e., social support and stress; sense of community and health) were also investigated. Overall, these studies provide evidence of reliability and validity related to the internal structure of the Personal On-Offline Social Capital Brief Scale in measuring online and offline bonding and bridging Social Capital and discriminating them from similar constructs. This scale is a useful instrument for planning public health interventions.\n']",academic:abstract,plos_scrapper.py,construction,20220928T101606,(abstract:construction) AND (injury OR safety OR health OR accident OR stress OR risk OR ohs) NOT (abstract:protein)

There is limited attention paid to the experiences of fathers of children born to women engaged in sex work. We examine the meaning of fatherhood to these men, the significance of children, and how they navigate the economic and cultural challenges of fatherhood in this context. Analysis is based on ethnographic data from 13 men who identified as intimate long-term partners of female sex workers (FSW) in Kampala City, Uganda. Our findings illustrate how men who have children with FSW struggled to model the traditional parameters of fatherhood and masculinity. We found that men who had children with FSW faced hurdles fitting within the social construction of ideal fatherhood. Accepting fatherhood often started with doubts over the pregnancy because of the multiple partnerships of women. Men who only saw themselves as clients struggled to adjust to being fathers because of their perceptions of the social implications of fathering a child with a FSW. Integration of mothers who were also sex workers into the man’s extended family was a challenge because of the fear of negative reactions from family members. However, when men accepted their roles as fathers, they started seeing value in their children. Due to poverty, most of the men fell short of the societal measures of masculinity, but children transformed their social status before their society and family. The provider role often used to define good fathering was a challenge for men. However, the financial support from FSW partners softened the burden and facilitated the creation of a family environment constructed to the perceived standards of the broader society. Our findings provide insights into the state of parenting among FSW and their partners which can guide interventions that are tailored to their unique circumstances.\n']",academic:abstract,plos_scrapper.py,construction,20220928T101606,(abstract:construction) AND (injury OR safety OR health OR accident OR stress OR risk OR ohs) NOT (abstract:protein)

In previous studies, key factors such as greenness, wetness, and temperature were extracted from satellite images to assess the urban ecological environment. Although air pollution has become increasingly serious as urbanisation proceeds, information on air pollution is not included in existing models. The Sentinel-5P satellite launched by the European Space Agency in 2017 is a reliable data source for monitoring air quality. By making full use of images from Landsat 8, Sentinel-2A, and Sentinel-5P, this work attempts to construct a new remote sensing monitoring index for urban ecology by adding air quality information to the existing remote sensing ecological index. The proposed index was tested in the Beijing metropolitan area using satellite data from 2020. The results obtained using the proposed index differ greatly in the central urban region and near large bodies of water from those obtained using the existing remote sensing monitoring model, indicating that air quality plays a significant role in evaluating the urban ecological environment. Because the model constructed in this study integrates information on vegetation, soil, humidity, heat, and air quality, it can comprehensively and objectively reflect the quality of the urban ecological environment. Consequently, the proposed remote sensing index provides a new approach to effectively monitoring the urban ecological environment.\n']",academic:abstract,plos_scrapper.py,construction,20220928T101606,(abstract:construction) AND (injury OR safety OR health OR accident OR stress OR risk OR ohs) NOT (abstract:protein)

Based on the data of prefecture-level cities in China from 2000 to 2018, this paper examines the impact and mechanism of selecting NDZs on urban green innovation through a double-difference spatial durbin model using the selection of NDZs as a “quasi-natural experiment”. The study finds that the selection of NDZs can promote green innovation in cities and has a significant window-radiating effect. The heterogeneity test results show that the implementation of the selection policy for development zones in non-old industrial cities, large and medium-sized cities, cities with easy access to transportation, and cities with high market orientation are more likely to promote urban green innovation. At the same time, the higher the level of government governance and the better the level of economic development of the development zones, the more it helps to realize the effects of the selection policy. The results of the mechanism test show that the selection of NDZs has a positive impact on urban green innovation through environmental regulation effects, resource allocation effects, and policy amplification effects.\n']",academic:abstract,plos_scrapper.py,construction,20220928T101606,(abstract:construction) AND (injury OR safety OR health OR accident OR stress OR risk OR ohs) NOT (abstract:protein)

Ending the COVID-19 pandemic depends on continued prevention behaviors such as mask wearing, distancing, hand hygiene, and limiting large gatherings. Research in low- and middle-income countries has focused on the prevalence of adherence and demographic determinants, but there is a need for a nuanced understanding of why people do or do not practice a given prevention behavior. The Breakthrough ACTION project led by Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs conducted a qualitative study in November 2020 in Côte d’Ivoire to explore people’s experience with and perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted 24 focus group discussions and 29 in-depth interviews with members of the general population and health providers. This analysis explores barriers and facilitators to seven recommended prevention behaviors with a particular focus on response efficacy, self-efficacy, and social norms. We found these constructs to be salient for participants who generally felt that the behaviors were useful for preventing COVID-19 but were difficult to practice for a variety of reasons. The perception that COVID-19 prevention behaviors were anti-social emerged as a key theme. Behavior change interventions must reframe the recommended behaviors as pro-social, while making them very easy to practice by removing social and structural barriers such as the expense or inaccessibility of masks and hand sanitizer.\n']",academic:abstract,plos_scrapper.py,construction,20220928T101606,(abstract:construction) AND (injury OR safety OR health OR accident OR stress OR risk OR ohs) NOT (abstract:protein)

In a community sample of 265 adults, we examined this assumption for three commonly used questionnaires of ISb, namely the Body Awareness subscale of the Body Perception Questionnaire (BPQ-BA), the Body Awareness Questionnaire (BAQ), and the eight subscales of Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA). We investigated their associations, and their relation to positive and negative affect and somatosensory amplification. According to the results of correlation analysis, BPQ-BA, BAQ and MAIA were partly unrelated to each other, partly showed weak to moderate positive associations. Also, differences with respect to their association with positive and negative affect were found. These findings suggest that the investigated questionnaires cannot be used interchangeably to assess the subjective aspect of interoception, and the term ISb is not appropriately defined.\n']",academic:abstract,plos_scrapper.py,construction,20220928T101606,(abstract:construction) AND (injury OR safety OR health OR accident OR stress OR risk OR ohs) NOT (abstract:protein)

Methods: A retrospective cohort of all registered ESRD patients (n = 553) was constructed over 8 years from 2011 to 2019, from 3 hemodialysis centers at Kerman, southeast of Iran. According to changes in MCI, patients were dichotomized to either the decline group or no-decline group. Subsequently the effect of interest was estimated using G-estimation and compared with accelerated failure time (AFT) Weibull models using two modelling strategies. Results: Standard models demonstrated survival time ratios of 0.91 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.64 to 1.28) and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.58 to 1.23) in patients in the decline MCI group compared to those in no-decline MCI group. This effect was demonstrated to be 0.57 (-95% CI: 0.21 to 0.81) using G-estimation. Conclusion: Declining in MCI increases mortality in patients with ESRD using G-estimation, while the AFT standard models yield biased effect estimate toward the null.

With the prospect of implementation, do children decide to go for the most creative ideas or do they shift towards ideas that are perhaps less creative but easier to construct? We conducted a field experiment to test whether expected construction affects children’s creative idea selection. In this experiment, 403 children were asked to select the most original ideas to make a toy elephant more fun to play with. We randomly assigned them to a treatment condition—in which they were informed they had to construct one of the original ideas that they selected—and a control group—in which children were informed that, after idea selection, they had to perform another task. Children who were instructed to construct the selected idea into a tangible product turned a blind eye to original ideas and preferred the more feasible ideas. Thus, pedagogical approaches that aim to stimulate creativity by instructing children to construct original ideas into tangible and physical products may unintentionally change children’s choices for creative ideas. This finding highlights the importance for educators of guiding children’s decision-making process in creative problem solving, and to be aware of children’s bias against original ideas when designing creative assignments for them.\n']",academic:abstract,plos_scrapper.py,construction,20220928T101606,(abstract:construction) AND (injury OR safety OR health OR accident OR stress OR risk OR ohs) NOT (abstract:protein)

To examine the efficiency of medical cooperation, medical provider and physician networks were constructed using patient claims data. Previous studies have shown that these networks contain information on medical cooperation. However, the usage patterns of multiple medical providers in a series of medical services have not been considered. In addition, these studies used only general network features to represent medical cooperation, but their expressive ability was low. To overcome these limitations, we analyzed the medical provider network to examine its overall contribution to the quality of healthcare provided by cooperation between medical providers in a series of medical services. This study focused on: i) the method of feature extraction from the network, ii) incorporation of the usage pattern of medical providers, and iii) expressive ability of the statistical model. Femoral neck fractures were selected as the target disease. To build the medical provider networks, we analyzed the patient claims data from a single prefecture in Japan between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2019. We considered four types of models. Models 1 and 2 use node strength and linear regression, with Model 2 also incorporating patient age as an input. Models 3 and 4 use feature representation by node2vec with linear regression and regression tree ensemble, a machine learning method. The results showed that medical providers with higher levels of cooperation reduce the duration of hospital stay. The overall contribution of the medical cooperation to the duration of hospital stay extracted from the medical provider network using node2vec is approximately 20%, which is approximately 20 times higher than the model using strength.\n']",academic:abstract,plos_scrapper.py,construction,20220928T101606,(abstract:construction) AND (injury OR safety OR health OR accident OR stress OR risk OR ohs) NOT (abstract:protein)

The ongoing acceleration of the worldwide urbanization process is leading to an exacerbation of the urban heat island effect; however, urban forestry can mitigate it. For a sustainable urban development, it is particularly important to evaluate the dual effect of both factors on the urban heat island phenomenon. In this study, we focused on Zhengzhou City (China), at the center of the Central Plains Forest City Cluster. The spatial and temporal evolutions of the local urban heat island and vegetation coverage were measured from Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 remote sensing images taken between 2006–2020 and the effects of urban construction and urban forestry on the urban heat island effect were evaluated. The results showed that, in the past 15 years, the high-temperature zone in the urban area of Zhengzhou City has gradually spread from its center to surrounding areas. Within the same period, the whole urban heat island has deteriorated and gradually improved: its area increased by 138.72 km2 between 2006–2014 and decreased by 135.66 km2 between 2014–2020. Notably, the development of vegetation coverage occurred consistently with the improvement of the heat island. A quantitative analysis of the relationship between urban construction, the urban forest, and the urban heat island has shown that factors like population density (representing urban construction), urban planning, and vegetation cover (representing the urban forest) all have an impact on the urban heat island. Based on the dynamic changes of the urban heat island in the urban area of Zhengzhou City between 2006–2020, we conclude that urban forest construction strategies are beginning to bear fruit. Overall, the findings of this study provide a theoretical basis for future urban construction and urban forest construction plans; moreover, they can support landscape pattern optimization and urban heat island mitigation.\n']",academic:abstract,plos_scrapper.py,construction,20220928T101606,(abstract:construction) AND (injury OR safety OR health OR accident OR stress OR risk OR ohs) NOT (abstract:protein)

We examined construct validity, reliability, floor and ceiling effects, and a longitudinal trend test of the KDIS items in the Southeastern Collaboration to Improve Blood Pressure Control trial. Methods: The KDIS items assess a practice’s progress toward implementing: a clinical information system (using their own data to drive change); standardized care processes; optimized team care; patient self-management support; and leadership support. We assessed construct validity and estimated reliability with a multilevel confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). A trend test examined whether the KDIS items increased over time and estimated the expected number of months needed to move a practice to the highest response options. Results: PFs completed monthly KDIS ratings over 12 months for 32 primary care practices, yielding a total of 384 observations. Data was fitted to a unidimensional CFA model; however, parameter fit was modest and could be improved. Reliability was 0.70. Practices started scoring at the highest levels beginning in month 5, indicating low variability. The KDIS items did show an upward trend over 12 months (all p < .001), indicating that practices were increasingly implementing key activities. The expected time to move a practice to the highest response category was 9.1 months for standardized care processes, 10.2 for clinical information system, 12.6 for self-management support, 13.1 for leadership, and 14.3 months for optimized team care.

However, to date, integrating studies linking positive psychological resources, such as Psychological Capital and influence regulation, with positive organizational outcomes are still scarce. Thus, the main aim of the present study was to examine the relationships of Psychological Capital and influence regulation with job satisfaction and job performance both at the individual and team levels. Methods: Within the cross-sectional multi-source research involving both team leaders and team members from 34 different teams, we examined the relationships of Psychological Capital and influence regulation with job satisfaction and job performance. The relationships of the study variables were based on the positive organizational behavior and the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions, which suggest the positive relationships of distinct positive psychological resources with positive work outcomes. Accordingly, in addition to the widely accepted concept of Psychological Capital (PsyCap), we employed and analyzed the complimentary construct of influence regulation (i.e., the ability to intentionally share social influence with others in the workplace) both at the individual and group levels. Results: The results of hierarchical linear modeling with 304 individuals from 34 teams from a diverse sample of Polish employees indicated that team members’ PsyCap was positively linked to individual-level job satisfaction and two facets of job performance, i.e. creative performance and in-role performance. In contrast, no relationship was found between influence regulation and job satisfaction or job performance at both levels of analysis. Conclusion: With regard to positive interpersonal resources, the findings highlight the role of PsyCap in predicting job satisfaction and job performance and broaden the understanding of positivity in the workplace by introducing the construct of influence regulation.

The main objective of this study was to examine the associations between trait EI, perceived stress and anxiety among Chinese medical students. Materials and methods: Self-report questionnaires, consisting of the Chinese versions of the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Short Form, the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, and demographic section were distributed to 1500 students at three medical universities in China. Hierarchical regression analyses were performed to examine the associations between trait EI, perceived stress and anxiety. Asymptotic and resampling strategies were utilized to examine the mediating effect of perceived stress. Results: A total number of 1388 medical students became final participants. After adjustment for demographics, while trait EI was strongly and negatively associated with anxiety, accounting for 21.1% of its variance, perceived stress was strongly and positively related to anxiety, explaining an additional 10.0% of the variance. Stress appeared to have a mediating effect on the association between trait EI and anxiety in students with high and moderate levels of stress, but not in low stress group. Conclusions: Both constructs of trait EI and perceived stress could be of vital importance to understand anxiety in medical students. Evidence-based strategies to enhance trait EI and reduce perceived stress might be undertaken to prevent and treat anxiety in the students.

Analysis of the data from 153 female university students was conducted using ordinal regressions, (a) separately and (b) merged with their 12 male counterparts. A separate gender analysis for males could not be performed, due to sample size limitations. Although access to nature and a considerable nature dose in terms of frequency and duration of nature contact were noted, possibly achieved through the engagement in outdoor activities, urban nature connectedness was rather low. Results showed that urban nature connectedness was negatively predicted by living in a rural area and positively predicted by engagement in outdoor activities and increased hours per week spent in nature. This information can help researchers operationalize the construct of urban nature connectedness. Furthermore, it can aid the development of interventions aimed at promoting urban nature connectedness, by encouraging urban inhabitants to (repeatedly) get in contact with and spend time in provided high-quality urban nature (e.g., during outdoor activities). To draw conclusions about causality, further research is required to identify a clear cause-effect relationship between socio-demographic characteristics and urban nature connectedness. Based on a researched dose-response relationship, a(n) (inter)national recommendation for the duration of nature contact should be established to promote urban nature connectedness and, therewith, health in urban inhabitants. Future research should also investigate further potential individual influencing factors, as well as gender and within/between-country differences among urban inhabitants.\n']",academic:abstract,plos_scrapper.py,construction,20220928T101606,(abstract:construction) AND (injury OR safety OR health OR accident OR stress OR risk OR ohs) NOT (abstract:protein)

As a dynamic and complex system, the stock market is affected by various factors. However, with the development of information technology, information presents multisource and heterogeneous characteristics, and the transmission speed and mode of information have changed greatly. The explanation and influence of multi-source and heterogeneous information on stock market price fluctuations need further study. In this paper, a graph fusion and embedding method for multi-source heterogeneous information of Chinese stock market is established. Relational dimension information is introduced to realize the effective fusion of multi-source heterogeneous data information. A multi-attention graph neural network based on nodes and semantics is constructed to mine the implied semantics of fusion graph data and capture the influence of multi-source heterogeneous information on stock market price fluctuations. Experiments show that the proposed multi-source heterogeneous information fusion methods is superior to tensor or vector fusion method, and the constructed multi-attention diagram neural network has a better ability to explain stock market price fluctuations.\n']",academic:abstract,plos_scrapper.py,construction,20220928T101606,(abstract:construction) AND (injury OR safety OR health OR accident OR stress OR risk OR ohs) NOT (abstract:protein)

However, studies have mainly focused on measuring technological convergence and have ignored the factors that affect the capabilities of such convergence capabilities. Thus, this study attempts to bridge this gap by providing an in-depth analysis of the impact of structural holes in inter-organizational technical cooperation networks. This technological convergence is studied from the perspective of a patent. It also considers the moderating effects of the degree of patent cooperation and the cooperation distance. It employs the social network theory to construct inter-organizational patent cooperation, and technological convergence networks, to facilitate the analysis of the effect of structural holes on such a convergence. It empirically examines 52 non-ferrous metal recycling organizations, with close patent cooperation. Accordingly, the structural hole constraint index by the inter-organizational patent cooperation network, shows a positive U-shaped curve relationship with technology convergence. Moreover, the degree of inter-organizational patent cooperation strengthens the positive U-shaped relationship, and the distance of cooperation weakens the influence of the structural hole constraint index on technology convergence. Therefore, managers and policymakers should encourage more industry-academia-research or patent alliances and designate policies to promote such cooperation.\n']",academic:abstract,plos_scrapper.py,construction,20220928T101606,(abstract:construction) AND (injury OR safety OR health OR accident OR stress OR risk OR ohs) NOT (abstract:protein)

These models strive to recapitulate key features of muscle architecture and function, such as cell alignment, maturation, and contractility in response to different stimuli. To this end, it is required to culture cells in biomimetic hydrogels suspended between two anchors. Currently available protocols are often complex to produce, have a high rate of breakage, or are not adapted to imaging and stimulation. Therefore, we sought to develop a simplified and reliable protocol, which still enabled versatility in the study of muscle function. In our method, we have used human immortalized myoblasts cultured in a hydrogel composed of MatrigelTM and fibrinogen, to create muscle strips suspended between two VELCROTM anchors. The resulting muscle constructs show a differentiated phenotype and contractile activity in response to electrical, chemical and optical stimulation. This activity is analyzed by two alternative methods, namely contraction analysis and calcium analysis with Fluo-4 AM. In all, our protocol provides an optimized version of previously published methods, enabling individual imaging of muscle bundles and straightforward analysis of muscle response with standard image analysis software. This system provides a start-to-finish guide on how to produce, validate, stimulate, and analyze bioengineered muscle.

The extensive habitat loss in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway (EAAF) may have potentially altered the virus spread and transmission, but those consequences are rarely studied. We constructed 6 fall migration networks that differed in their level of habitat loss, wherein an increase in habitat loss resulted in smaller networks with fewer sites and links. We integrated an agent-based model and a susceptible-infected-recovered model to simulate waterfowl migration and AIV transmission. We found that extensive habitat loss in the EAAF can 1) relocate the outbreaks northwards, responding to the distribution changes of wintering waterfowl geese, 2) increase the outbreak risk in remaining sites due to larger goose congregations, and 3) facilitate AIV transmission in the migratory population. In addition, our modeling output was in line with the predictions from the concept of “migratory escape”, i.e., the migration allows the geese to “escape” from the location where infection risk is high, affecting the pattern of infection prevalence in the waterfowl population. Our modeling shed light on the potential consequences of habitat loss in spreading and transmitting AIV at the flyway scale and suggested the driving mechanisms behind these effects, indicating the importance of conservation in changing spatial and temporal patterns of AIV outbreaks.\nAuthor summary: What are the possible consequences of extensive habitat loss on the spread and transmission of avian influenza viruses (AIVs)? We used a logistic regression model to select the suitable habitats of Greater white-fronted goose Anser albifrons in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, which has extensive habitat loss and seasonal passing waterfowl population. We treated these habitats as sites to construct 6 fall migration networks by removing sites in order of habitat loss (i.e., site removal). We then simulated geese migration in these networks and explored the impacts of habitat loss on AIV spread and transmission. We found that extensive habitat loss can cause relocation of the geese and outbreaks and promote the AIV spread and transmission. Our modeling outputs also suggested a “migratory escape” pattern for changing the spatial and temporal pattern of infection prevalence in the population. Overall, our study showed that habitat loss can affect AIV spread and transmission, suggesting the importance of habitat conservation in changing the spatial and temporal pattern of disease prevalence.

It is considered fundamental to developing emotional awareness. For this reason, interoceptive deficits are often associated with alexithymia, a condition characterized by difficulty identifying feelings (DIF), difficulty describing feelings (DDF), and an externally-oriented style of thinking (EOT). Yet, the atypical interoception found in alexithymia might be of a similar type and/or more serious than those found in other partially overlapping constructs that entail emotional difficulties and behavioural patterns associated with specific emotional styles. Our study explores this issue by examining the relationship between the interoceptive deficits associated with alexithymia and the Big Five personality traits. A non-clinical sample (N = 504) completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale, the Big Five Inventory and the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness. Data were analysed using a network analytic approach that conceives psychological traits as networks of interacting symptoms. The estimated network highlighted that EOT is the alexithymia component least associated with interoception and most associated with lower Openness to Experience. Conversely, DIF and Neuroticism are, respectively, the dimensions of alexithymia and the Big Five most highly associated with interoception. We also compared interoceptive abilities in the four groups of participants whose scores were a) high for both alexithymia and neuroticism, b) high only for alexithymia c), high only for neuroticism, and d) low for both. High alexithymia was especially associated with the tendency to ignore sensations of pain or discomfort, while neuroticism was more indicative of the tendency to worry about these sensations. These results suggest that while high alexithymia and neuroticism share some interoceptive deficits, others are unique to alexithymia and contribute to overall lower interoceptive ability in this condition. Our findings suggest that interventions to enhance awareness of bodily sensations can be beneficial especially for profiles who present high neuroticism and alexithymia.\n']",academic:abstract,plos_scrapper.py,construction,20220928T101606,(abstract:construction) AND (injury OR safety OR health OR accident OR stress OR risk OR ohs) NOT (abstract:protein)

These changes can have significant implications for human health. However, due to the difficulty in obtaining longitudinal samples, the study of the dynamic relationship between the microbiome and human health remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a novel computational strategy that uses massive cross-sectional sample data to model microbiome landscapes associated with chronic disease development. The strategy is based on the rationale that each static sample provides a snapshot of the disease process, and if the number of samples is sufficiently large, the footprints of individual samples populate progression trajectories, which enables us to recover disease progression paths along a microbiome landscape by using computational approaches. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed strategy, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline and applied it to a gut microbiome dataset available from a Crohn’s disease study. Our analysis resulted in one of the first working models of microbial progression for Crohn’s disease. We performed a series of interrogations to validate the constructed model. Our analysis suggested that the model recapitulated the longitudinal progression of microbial dysbiosis during the known clinical trajectory of Crohn’s disease.

DNA loading on the central channel of the Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 complex is required to execute its biological functions. Because Rad9A has the highest DNA affinity among the three subunits, we determined the domains and functional residues of human Rad9A that are critical for DNA interaction. The N-terminal globular domain (residues 1–133) had 3.7-fold better DNA binding affinity than the C-terminal globular domain (residues 134–266) of Rad9A1-266. Rad9A1-266 binds DNA 16-, 60-, and 30-fold better than Rad9A1-133, Rad9A134-266, and Rad9A94-266, respectively, indicating that different regions cooperatively contribute to DNA binding. We show that basic residues including K11, K15, R22, K78, K220, and R223 are important for DNA binding. The reductions on DNA binding of Ala substituted mutants of these basic residues show synergistic effect and are dependent on their residential Rad9A deletion constructs. Interestingly, deletion of a loop (residues 160–163) of Rad9A94-266 weakens DNA binding activity by 4.1-fold as compared to wild-type (WT) Rad9A94-266. Cellular sensitivity to genotoxin of rad9A knockout cells is restored by expressing WT-Rad9Afull. However, rad9A knockout cells expressing Rad9A mutants defective in DNA binding are more sensitive to H2O2 as compared to cells expressing WT-Rad9Afull. Only the rad9A knockout cells expressing loop-deleted Rad9A mutant are more sensitive to hydroxyurea than cells expressing WT-Rad9A.

In recent years, it has become possible to construct complex predictive models for phenotypes, thanks to the availability of large genome data sets as well as efficient and scalable machine learning tools. In this paper, we make a threefold contribution to this problem. First, we ask if state-of-the-art nonlinear predictive models, such as boosted decision trees, can be more efficient for phenotype prediction than conventional linear models. We find that this is indeed the case if model features include a sufficiently rich set of covariates, but probably not otherwise. Second, we ask if the conventional selection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by genome wide association studies (GWAS) can be replaced by a more efficient procedure, taking into account information in previously selected SNPs. We propose such a procedure, based on a sequential feature importance estimation with decision trees, and show that this approach indeed produced informative SNP sets that are much more compact than when selected with GWAS. Finally, we show that the highest prediction accuracy can ultimately be achieved by ensembling individual linear and nonlinear models.

However, there are few examples where a spatially and temporally explicit model has been used to evaluate the migratory dynamics of a bird population across its entire annual cycle. We used geolocator-derived migration tracks of 84 Dunlin (Calidris alpina) on the East Asian-Australasian Flyway (EAAF) to construct a migratory network describing annual subspecies-specific migration patterns in space and time. We found that Dunlin subspecies exhibited unique patterns of spatial and temporal flyway use. Spatially, C. a. arcticola predominated in regions along the eastern edge of the flyway (e.g., western Alaska and central Japan), whereas C. a. sakhalina predominated in regions along the western edge of the flyway (e.g., N China and inland China). No individual Dunlin that wintered in Japan also wintered in the Yellow Sea, China seas, or inland China, and vice-versa. However, similar proportions of the 4 subspecies used many of the same regions at the center of the flyway (e.g., N Sakhalin Island and the Yellow Sea). Temporally, Dunlin subspecies staggered their south migrations and exhibited little temporal overlap among subspecies within shared migration regions. In contrast, Dunlin subspecies migrated simultaneously during north migration. South migration was also characterized by individuals stopping more often and for more days than during north migration. Taken together, these spatial-temporal migration dynamics indicate Dunlin subspecies may be differentially affected by regional habitat change and population declines according to where and when they occur. We suggest that the migration dynamics presented here are useful for guiding on-the-ground survey efforts to quantify subspecies’ use of specific sites, and to estimate subspecies’ population sizes and long-term trends.

There is a growing need for methods to efficiently construct epigenetic clocks. The most common approach is to create clocks using elastic net regression modelling of all measured CpG sites, without first identifying specific features or CpGs of interest. The addition of feature selection approaches provides the opportunity to optimise the identification of predictive CpG sites. Here, we apply novel feature selection methods and combinatorial approaches including newly adapted neural networks, genetic algorithms, and ‘chained’ combinations. Human whole blood methylation data of ~470,000 CpGs was used to develop clocks that predict age with R2 correlation scores of greater than 0.73, the most predictive of which uses 35 CpG sites for a R2 correlation score of 0.87. The five most frequent sites across all clocks were modelled to build a clock with a R2 correlation score of 0.83. These two clocks are validated on two external datasets where they maintain excellent predictive accuracy. When compared with three published epigenetic clocks (Hannum, Horvath, Weidner) also applied to these validation datasets, our clocks outperformed all three models. We identified gene regulatory regions associated with selected CpGs as possible targets for future aging studies. Thus, our feature selection algorithms build accurate, generalizable clocks with a low number of CpG sites, providing important tools for the field.\nAuthor summary: Epigenetic clocks accurately predict a person’s age by measuring the levels of a chemical mark (methylation) at specific sites of the DNA. More of these clocks are being built all the time, and there is a need for tools to best construct these clocks, and particularly to pick the specific DNA sites to include. We propose several novel machine-learning tools for the optimised selection of these DNA sites, known as feature selection approaches. We applied our approaches to a large human blood dataset to develop several clocks that accurately predict age using 35 or less DNA sites with more accuracy than previously published clocks when applied to other datasets for validation. Some of the DNA sites identified may be associated with interesting genes to explore further for their role in aging. These approaches should enable the building of more accurate, generalizable age prediction clocks from a low number of DNA sites.

With unstandardized coefficient (standard error) self-efficacy0.10 (0.01) being the strongest cues to action0.10 (0.02), perceived threat0.02 (0.01), and perceived barrier-0.08(0.01) constructs of HBM have a significant effect on dietary practice. Knowledge, social support and diabetes distress exert a significant indirect effect on dietary practice through health belief constructs with unstandardized path coefficient (standard error) of 0.22(0.03), 0.02(0.01), and -0.03(0.004) respectively. Conclusion: In this study, the proportion of good practice is found to be lower for both dietary as well as general self-care. HBM can best fit to explain variability in dietary self-care practice; therefore, future interventions should be designed to address the vast perception and psychosocial factors influencing dietary self-care practices.

56,PLOS ONE,2022-08-15T00:00:00Z,Development of a diarrhoea severity scoring scale in a passive health facility-based surveillance system,"['Background: Diarrhoeal disease remains a leading cause of death among children mostly in low and middle-income countries. Factors contributing to disease severity are complex and there is currently no consensus on a scoring tool for use in community-based studies. Methods: Data were collected during a passive surveillance system in an outpatient health facility in Lusaka, Zambia from March 2019 to July 2019. Diarrhea episodes were assessed for severity using an in-house severity scoring tool (CIDRZ) and previously published scores (Vesikari, Clark, CODA, and DHAKA). The CIDRZ score was constructed using fieldworker-reported clinical signs and exploratory factor analysis. We used precision-recall curves measuring severe diarrhoea (i.e., requiring intravenous rehydration or referred for hospital admission) to determine the best performing scores. Then, we used Cronbach’s alpha to assess the scale’s internal consistency. Finally, we used Cohen’s kappa to assess agreement between the scores. Results: Of 110 diarrhea episodes, 3 (3%) required intravenous rehydration or were referred for hospital admission. The precision-recall area under the curve of each score as a predictor of severe diarrhoea requiring intravenous rehydration or hospital admission was 0.26 for Vesikari, 0.18 for CODA, 0.24 for Clark, 0.59 for DHAKA, and 0.59 for CIDRZ. The CIDRZ scale had substantial reliability and performed similarly to the DHAKA score. Conclusions: Diarrhoea severity scores focused on characteristics specific to dehydration status may better predict severe diarrhea among children in Lusaka. Aetiology-specific scoring tools may not be appropriate for use in community healthcare settings. Validation studies for the CIDRZ score in diverse settings and with larger sample sizes are warranted.

Public sentiment mining based on microblog data can provide a reference for the government’s information disclosure, public sentiment guidance and formulation of epidemic prevention and control policy. In this paper, about 200,000 pieces of text data were collected from Jan. 1 to Feb. 26, 2020 from Sina Weibo, which is the most popular microblog website in China. And a public sentiment analysis framework suitable for Chinese-language scenarios was proposed. In this framework, a sentiment dictionary suitable for Chinese-language scenarios was constructed, and Baidu’s Sentiment Analysis API was used to calculate the public sentiment indexes. Then, an analysis on the correlation between the public sentiment indexes and the COVID-19 case indicators was made. It was discovered that there is a high correlation between public sentiments and incidence trends, in which negative sentiment is of statistical significance for the prediction of epidemic development. To further explore the source of public negative sentiment, the topics of the public negative sentiment on Weibo was analyzed, and 20 topics in five categories were got. It is found that there is a strong linkage between the hot spots of public concern and the epidemic prevention and control policies. If the policies cover the hot spots of public concern in a timely and effective manner, the public negative sentiment will be effectively alleviated. The analytical framework proposed in this paper also applies to the public sentiment analysis and policy making for other major public events.\n']",academic:abstract,plos_scrapper.py,construction,20220928T101606,(abstract:construction) AND (injury OR safety OR health OR accident OR stress OR risk OR ohs) NOT (abstract:protein)

This index aspires to mitigate data scarcity for cities and to provide policy makers with the tools for monitoring the evolving role of cities in the global economy. Analytically, we implement the economic complexity methodology on data for the ownership, location and economic activities of the world’s 3,000 largest firms and their subsidiaries to propose a new indicator that quantifies the network of the largest cities worldwide and the economic activities of their globalized firms. We first show that complex cities are the highly diversified cities that host non-ubiquitous economic activities of firms with global presence. Then, in a sample of EU cities, we show that complex cities tend to be more prosperous, have higher population, and are associated with more jobs, human capital, innovation, technology and transport infrastructure. Last, using OLS methodology and accounting for several other confounders, we show that a higher ECI, at the city level, enhances the resilience of cities to negative economic shocks, i.e., their ability to bounce back after a shock. Specifically, we find that the expected increase of the ratio of employment in 2012 over 2006 is 0.01 (mean: 0.992; standard deviation: 0.081) when the ECI increases by 1 unit (mean: 0.371; standard deviation: 1.094), i.e., a satisfactory pace of recovery, in terms of employment. The ability to diversify in the presence of a shock, the reallocation of factors of production to other sectors and the ability to extract rents associated with those diversified activities, uncovers the mechanics of the ECI index.\n']",academic:abstract,plos_scrapper.py,construction,20220928T101606,(abstract:construction) AND (injury OR safety OR health OR accident OR stress OR risk OR ohs) NOT (abstract:protein)

Early culture conversion status has long been used as a predictor of good treatment outcomes and an important infection control metric, as culture-negative patients are less likely to spread tuberculosis. There is also evidence that suggests that delayed sputum conversion is linked to negative outcomes. Therefore, this study was aimed at developing a nomogram to predict the risk of late culture conversion in patients with multi-drug resistant tuberculosis using readily available predictors. Objective: The objective of this study was to develop and validate a risk prediction nomogram for the prediction of late culture conversion among multi-drug resistant tuberculosis patients in North-West Ethiopia. Methods: Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis data from the University of Gondar and the Debre Markos referral hospitals have been used and a total of 316 patients were involved. The analysis was carried out using STATA version 16 and R version 4.0.5 statistical software. Based on the binomial logistic regression model, a validated simplified risk prediction model (nomogram) was built, and its performance was evaluated by assessing its discriminatory power and calibration. Finally, decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to assess the generated model’s clinical and public health impact. Results: Registration group, HIV co-infection, baseline BMI, baseline sputum smear grade, and radiological abnormalities were prognostic determinants used in the construction of the nomogram. The model has a discriminating power of 0.725 (95% CI: 0.669, 0.781) and a P-value of 0.665 in the calibration test. It was internally validated using the bootstrapping method, and it was found to perform similarly to the model developed on the entire dataset. The decision curve analysis revealed that the model has better clinical and public health impact than other strategies specified. Conclusion: The developed nomogram, which has a satisfactory level of accuracy and good calibration, can be utilized to predict late culture conversion in MDR-TB patients. The model has been found to be useful in clinical practice and is clinically interpretable.

This presents a problem for the measurement of political knowledge, because, according to recent scholarship, unsupervised measurement of political knowledge in web-based surveys suffers from respondent dishonesty. This study examines the validity of five possible survey proxies for political knowledge: self-assessed sophistication, political interest, internal political efficacy, accuracy of party placements on a left-right dimension and political participation. The analysis draws on a 2020 survey data (n = 1,097) and partial replications with identical measures from a 2008 survey data (n = 1,021) from Finland. Through several tests, the five proxies are assessed in terms of convergent validity, criterion validity and predictive validity. Across all tests, political interest performs best on all dimensions of validity and demonstrates largely identical relationships with political knowledge.

Previous studies have found that higher JEE scores are associated with fewer communicable disease deaths. But given the impact of COVID-19 in many countries, including those believed to have developed IHR capacities, the validity of the JEE for pandemic preparedness has been questioned. We constructed univariable and multivariable linear regression models to investigate the relationship between JEE scores and i) deaths from communicable diseases before the pandemic and ii) deaths from COVID-19. We adjusted for country differences in age, health system access, national wealth, health expenditure, democratic governance, government restrictions, pre-pandemic tourist arrivals and testing capacity (estimated by test positivity rates). For COVID-19 deaths, we calculated cumulative deaths per 100,000 at 3, 6 and 12 months into the pandemic. A total of 91 countries were included, with a median JEE score of 50%. On multivariable linear regression the association between JEE scores and log COVID-19 deaths was significant and positive at 3 months (β 0.05, p = 0.02), becoming statistically non-significant, at 6 (β 0.02, p = 0.27) and 12 months (β -0.03, p = 0.19), while the association with log communicable disease deaths was significant and negative (β -0.03, p = 0.003). A higher Stringency Index was significantly associated with higher log COVID-19 deaths at 3 (β 0.04, p = 0.003) and 6 (β 0.04, p = 0.001) months, but not at 12 months (β 0.02, p = 0.08). Higher test positivity rates were associated with higher log COVID-19 deaths at all time points, at least partially attenuating the positive association between Stringency Index and log COVID-19 deaths. While universal health coverage indices (β -0.04 p<0.001) and international tourist arrivals were associated with log communicable disease deaths (β 0.02, p = 0.002), they were not associated with log COVID-19 deaths.

These factors are directly implicated in native salmon and steelhead (Oncorhynchus species) population declines and also indirectly cause mortality by altering outcomes of ecological interactions. For example, attenuated flows and warmer water temperatures drive increased parasite densities and in turn, overwhelm salmonid resistance thresholds, resulting in high disease and mortality. Outcomes of interactions between the freshwater myxozoan parasite, Ceratonova shasta, and its salmonid hosts (e.g., coho O. kisutch and Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha) are well-described, but less is known about effects on chum salmon O. keta, which have a comparatively brief freshwater residency. The goal of this study was to describe the distribution of C. shasta relative to chum salmon habitat in the CRB and assess its potential to cause mortality in juvenile chum salmon (listed as threatened in the CRB under the U.S. Endangered Species Act). We measured C. shasta densities in water samples collected from chum salmon habitat throughout the lower CRB during the period of juvenile chum salmon outmigration, 2018–2020. In 2019, we exposed caged chum salmon fry from two hatchery stocks at three C. shasta-positive sites to assess infection prevalence and survival. Results demonstrated: (1) C. shasta was detected in spawning streams from which chum salmon have been extirpated but was not detected in contemporary spawning habitat while juvenile chum salmon were present, (2) spatiotemporal overlap occurs between C. shasta and juvenile chum salmon in the Columbia River mainstem, and (3) low densities of C. shasta caused lethal infection in chum salmon fry from both hatchery stocks.

Methods: This retrospective cohort study used linked healthcare records from SCI-Diabetes, the population-based diabetes register of Scotland. We studied all individuals aged 50 and older with a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes who were alive and residing in Scotland on 1 January 2013 (N = 8591). We used the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) 2016 as an area-based measure of socioeconomic deprivation. For each individual, we constructed a history of transitions by capturing whether individuals developed retinopathy/maculopathy, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetic foot, or died throughout the study period, which lasted until 31 December 2018. Using parametric multistate survival models, we estimated total and state-specific LE at an attained age of 50. Results: At age 50, remaining LE was 22.2 years (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 21.6 − 22.8) for males and 25.1 years (95% CI: 24.4 − 25.9) for females. Remaining LE at age 50 was around 8 years lower among the most deprived SIMD quintile when compared with the least deprived SIMD quintile: 18.7 years (95% CI: 17.5 − 19.9) vs. 26.3 years (95% CI: 24.5 − 28.1) among males, and 21.2 years (95% CI: 19.7 − 22.7) vs. 29.3 years (95% CI: 27.5 − 31.1) among females. The gap in life years spent without complications was around 5 years between the most and the least deprived SIMD quintile: 4.9 years (95% CI: 3.6 − 6.1) vs. 9.3 years (95% CI: 7.5 − 11.1) among males, and 5.3 years (95% CI: 3.7 − 6.9) vs. 10.3 years (95% CI: 8.3 − 12.3) among females. SIMD differences in transition rates decreased marginally when controlling for time-updated information on risk factors such as HbA1c, blood pressure, BMI, or smoking.

We aimed to assess the views of stakeholders in relation to these treatment options. Methodology: In a mixed methods study, we surveyed and interviewed patients, government functionaries, programme managers, health service providers, nongovernmental organizations, researchers, and World Health Organization (WHO) personnel. We used the Evidence to Decision (EtD) framework for data collection planning and analysis. Constructs of interest included valuation of outcomes, impact on equity, feasibility and acceptability of the treatment options, implementation considerations, monitoring and evaluation, and research priorities. Principal findings/Conclusion: Mortality and non-serious adverse events were rated as “critical” by respectively the highest (61%) and lowest percentages (47%) of survey participants. Participants viewed clinical cure as essential for patients to regain productivity. Non-patient stakeholders emphasized the importance of “sustained” clinical cure. For most survey participants, combination therapy, compared with monotherapy, would increase health equity (40%), and be more acceptable (79%) and feasible (57%). Interviews revealed that combination therapy was more feasible and acceptable than monotherapy when associated with a shorter duration of hospitalization. The findings of the interviews provided insight into those of the survey. When choosing between alternative options, providers should consider the outcomes that matter to patients as well as the impact on equity, feasibility, and acceptability of the options. Author summary: In East Africa and South Asia, the number of patients with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been increasing over the years. In addition to independently posing major health challenges, the two conditions have detrimental effects on each other. In light of new evidence on treatment regimens for this patient population, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently updated its evidence-based region-specific treatment recommendations. To inform this process, we assessed the views of stakeholders on the outcomes of interest and on medication treatment options. The mixed methods study consisted of an online survey and semi-structured interviews. Outcomes such as mortality, complications, clinical cure, relapse and serious adverse events were viewed as important because of the burden associated with their experience, their consequences, and the co-infection status of the patients. Outcomes such as non-serious adverse events were viewed as less important for reasons relating to patient tolerability and ease of treatment. As compared to monotherapy, combination therapy was found to be more equitable, acceptable, and feasible. While our findings are important to consider by clinicians treating patients with VL patients coinfected with HIV, they also inform decisions made by other stakeholders such as guideline developers and program managers.

Interestingly, our previous study has demonstrated the underlying mechanism that foreign insertions reduce the replication/transcription capacity of the modified segment, impairing the delicate balance among the multiple segments during IAV infection. In the present study, we developed a “balance compensation” strategy by incorporating additional compensatory mutations during initial construction of recombinant IAVs to expand the tolerance of IAV genome. As a proof of concept, promoter-enhancing mutations were introduced within the modified segment to rectify the segments imbalance of a reporter influenza PR8-NS-Gluc virus, while directed optimization of the recombinant IAV was successfully achieved. Further, we generated recombinant IAVs expressing a much larger firefly luciferase (Fluc) by coupling with a much stronger compensatory enhancement, and established robust Fluc-based live-imaging mouse models of IAV infection. Our strategy feasibly expands the tolerance for foreign gene insertions in the segmented IAV genome, which opens up better opportunities to develop more versatile reporter IAVs as well as live attenuated influenza virus-based vaccines for other important human pathogens.\nAuthor summary: Foreign nucleotide insertions often interfere with the replication/transcription of the modified segment of IAV genome, impairing the delicate balance of the segmented genome during IAV infection. In general the larger the insertion is, the more the balance is impaired. The limited tolerance of IAV genome greatly restricts the creation and application of recombinant IAVs. In this study, we developed a “balance compensation” strategy to expand the tolerance of IAV genome. In coupled with appropriate compensatory enhancement during initial construction, recombinant IAVs harboring much larger foreign insertions are successfully generated and maintain genetically stable, facilitating their use as powerful tools, e.g., the reporter IAVs and live-attenuated influenza virus-vectored vaccines.

Using a wood turtle (Glyptemys insculpta) population graph, we introduce BRIDES as a new tool to evaluate populations for conservation purpose without focusing solely on individual nodes. BRIDES characterizes different types of shortest paths among the nodes of a subgraph and compares the shortest paths among the same nodes in a complete network. The main objectives of this study were to (1) introduce a BRIDES selection process to assist conservation biologists in the prioritization of populations, and (2) use different centrality indices and node removal statistics to compare BRIDES results and assess gene flow among wood turtle populations. We constructed six population subgraphs and used a stepwise selection algorithm to choose the optimal number of additional nodes, representing different populations, required to maximize network connectivity under different weighting schemes. Our results demonstrate the robustness of the BRIDES selection process for a given scenario, while inconsistencies were observed among node-based metrics. Results showed repeated selection of certain wood turtle populations, which could have not been predicted following only genetic diversity and distinctiveness estimation, node-based metrics and node removal analysis. Contrary to centrality measures focusing on static networks, BRIDES allowed for the analysis of evolving networks. To our knowledge, this study is the first to apply graph theory for turtle conservation genetics. We show that population graphs can reveal complex gene flow dynamics and population resiliency to local extinction. As such, BRIDES offers an interesting complement to node-based metrics and node removal to better understand the global processes at play when addressing population prioritization frameworks.\n']",academic:abstract,plos_scrapper.py,construction,20220928T101606,(abstract:construction) AND (injury OR safety OR health OR accident OR stress OR risk OR ohs) NOT (abstract:protein)

In order to achieve this, citizens need certain health insurance literacy skills. It is not known how far citizens in the Netherlands have these skills. The aim of this study is to provide a reliable instrument that measures the health insurance literacy of citizens in the Netherlands. It would be based upon an existing instrument developed in the US. We translated the US Health Insurance Literacy Measure (HILM) into Dutch. Furthermore, we established the psychometric properties of the Dutch version (HILM-NL), and we validated the HILM-NL in a general population sample by sending surveys to members of the Nivel Dutch Health Care Consumer Panel (DHCCP) in February and March 2020. The response rates were respectively 54% (n = 806) and 56% (n = 595). No insurmountable difficulties with equivalence were encountered throughout the translation process. The HILM-NL showed an acceptable level of internal consistency, good test-retest reliability, and a good construct validity. The HILM-NL is a reliable instrument for measuring health insurance literacy among citizens in the Netherlands. With this instrument, it is better possible both to assess how these citizens choose and use a health insurance policy, and also the difficulties they face.

In this study, we observed the three-dimensional development of burrows produced by the tiger pistol shrimp Alpheus bellulus in a tank using an X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner. CT scanning was performed at 10–30 min intervals immediately after the start of burrow construction. The three-dimensional morphology (surface area, volume, depth, length, and diameter) of burrows at each observation time was imaged and measured. In addition, the rate of increase of each parameter was calculated. Surface area, volume, length, and depth rapidly increased immediately after the start of the experiment in all burrows. Subsequently, there was a reduction in the rate of increase at 40 min after the start of excavation for burrow depth, at 75 min for length, and at 90 min for surface area and volume. Although there were large differences in burrow diameter among the burrows immediately after the start of the experiment, all burrows reached nearly identical diameters after 90 min. Changes in burrow morphology were not observed in most of the burrows more than 210 min after the start of the experiment, meaning that A. bellulus can create burrows that are sufficient for survival within this time period. The use of CT scans in this study clarified the developmental process of the three-dimensional structure of A. bellulus burrows and is applicable to various burrow-producing organisms.

Sabah is in the Eastern part of Malaysia and is populated by multi-ethnic groups. To date, limited studies on stature estimation have been conducted in Sabah. Hence, this study aims to construct population-specific stature estimation equations for the large ethnic groups in Sabah, Malaysia. Objective: The aim is to propose linear models using different hand dimensions (hand span, handbreadth, hand length, middle finger length, and the second inter-crease in the middle finger) for the young adult male and females of the major ethnic groups in Sabah. Materials & methods: This cross-sectional study framework used stratified random sampling on 184 male and 184 female young adults. An unpaired t-test and a one-way ANOVA were used to assess the differences in the mean between sex and ethnicities, respectively. The link between the response variable and explanatory variables was initially investigated using simple linear regression, followed by multiple linear regression. Result: The present study demonstrated the highest association for the quantitative explanatory variables among hand length and stature (right side: r = 0.833; left side: r = 0.842). Simple equations were specifically developed without sex indicators, and ethnic and multiple linear regression was developed with sex and ethnic indicators. Multiple linear regression provided good estimation r2 = 0.7886 and adjusted r2 = 0.7853. The stature of 18 to 25 year old large ethnic groups in Sabah can be estimated using the developed models 90.218 + 3.845 LHL -5.950 Sex—2.308 Bajau -1.673 KadazanDusun + 2.676 L2ICL.

78,PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases,2022-08-30T00:00:00Z,Metagenomic detection of eumycetoma causative agents   from households of patients residing in two Sudanese endemic villages in White Nile State,"['\nEumycetoma is a chronic debilitating fungal disease endemic to tropical and subtropical regions, with Sudan featuring the highest eumycetoma incidence. Among the 50 species of fungi most commonly associated with eumycetoma Madurella mycetomatis (M. mycetomatis) is often referenced as the most common pathogen. However, there is an enormous knowledge gap related to this neglected disease and its pathogenesis, epidemiological features, and host-specific factors that could contribute to either the host susceptibility and resistance. In this study, we were able to utilize a metagenomic approach and samples collected from clinical black grains (BG) and familiar household environments aimed to assay both the habitat of eumycetoma-associated fungi and its possible connection with eumycetoma patients living in two different eumycetoma endemic villages within the White Nile State of Sudan. DNA sequencing targeting the fungal ITS2 domain was performed on soil, animal dung, housing walls and roofs, and Acacia-species thorn samples and compared with culture-dependent methods of fungal isolation. Additionally, we compared the soil samples obtained in the endemic zone with that from non-endemic zones, including Wagga village in Kassala State and Port Sudan suburb in Port Sudan State. Overall, a total of 392 Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) were detected by ITS2 metagenomics Eumycetoma causative organisms accounted for 10% of total ASVs which included 11 genera: Exserohilum (2%), Aspergillus (1.7%), Curvularia (1%), Alternaria (0.9%), Madurella (0.5%), Fusarium (0.4%), Cladosporium (0.2%) Exophiala (0.15%), and, in a lesser extent, Microascus (0.05%) Bipolaris and Acremonium (0.01%) for each. Only five genera were identified by culture method, which included Fusarium (29%), Aspergillus (28%), Alternaria (2.5%), Bipolaris (1.6%), and Chaetomium (0.8%). M. mycetomatis was detected within all the studied patients’ houses, accounting for 0.7% of total sequences. It was the first common eumycetoma-associated agent detected in soil samples and the third common in the dung and wall samples. In contrast, it was not detected in the roof or thorn samples nor in the soils from non-endemic regions. Exserohilum rostratum, Aspergillus spp and Cladosporium spp were detected in all samples. M. mycetomatis and other eumycetoma-associated fungal identified in the patients’ black grains (BG) samples by metagenomics were identified in the environmental samples. Only Acremonium alternatum and Falciformispora senegalensis, responsible for eumycetoma in two patients were not detected, suggesting the infections in these patients happened outside these endemic areas. The soil, animal dung, and houses built from the same soil and dung are the main risk factors for M. mycetomatis infection in these endemic villages. Furthermore, the poor hygienic and environmental conditions, walking barefooted, and the presence of animals within the houses increase the risk of M. mycetomatis and other fungi causing eumycetoma.\nAuthor summary: In this pilot study, using a metagenomic approach, we revealed in two Sudanese eumycetoma endemic villages within the While Nile State in Sudan, the habitat of M. mycetomatis and other fungal species responsible for eumycetoma. Although never isolated in culture, M. mycetomatis represented the most abundant eumycetoma-associated species found within soil samples and the third most common species within dung and housing wall samples. All the eumycetoma-associated fungal species detected by metagenomic in black grains samples were identified in patient’s houses, except Falciformispora senegalensis and Acremonium alternatum. The findings obtained in this study provided insight into the habitat of eumycetoma-associated causative species and improved knowledge on eumycetoma origin and risk factors in endemic villages. Furthermore, despite the limited number of samples, these results suggest the main prevention measurements to contain eumycetoma in these endemic areas. These measurements include using gloves and alternative materials to endemic soil and animal dung in building the wall of the houses walls, constructing animal fences and appropriate use of footwear.

79,PLOS Computational Biology,2022-08-25T00:00:00Z,Archetypal Analysis for population genetics,"['\nThe estimation of genetic clusters using genomic data has application from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to demographic history to polygenic risk scores (PRS) and is expected to play an important role in the analyses of increasingly diverse, large-scale cohorts. However, existing methods are computationally-intensive, prohibitively so in the case of nationwide biobanks. Here we explore Archetypal Analysis as an efficient, unsupervised approach for identifying genetic clusters and for associating individuals with them. Such unsupervised approaches help avoid conflating socially constructed ethnic labels with genetic clusters by eliminating the need for exogenous training labels. We show that Archetypal Analysis yields similar cluster structure to existing unsupervised methods such as ADMIXTURE and provides interpretative advantages. More importantly, we show that since Archetypal Analysis can be used with lower-dimensional representations of genetic data, significant reductions in computational time and memory requirements are possible. When Archetypal Analysis is run in such a fashion, it takes several orders of magnitude less compute time than the current standard, ADMIXTURE. Finally, we demonstrate uses ranging across datasets from humans to canids.\nAuthor summary: This work introduces a method that combines the singular value decomposition (SVD) with Archetypal Analysis to perform fast and accurate genetic clustering by first reducing the dimensionality of the space of genomic sequences. Each sequence is described as a convex combination (admixture) of archetypes (cluster representatives) in the reduced dimensional space. We compare this interpretable approach to the widely used genetic clustering algorithm, ADMIXTURE, and show that, without significant degradation in performance, Archetypal Analysis outperforms, offering shorter run times and representational advantages. We include theoretical, qualitative, and quantitative comparisons between both methods.

We address two challenges: 1) limited number of cases in MRSI datasets and 2) interpretability of results in the form of relevant spectral regions. Methods: A shallow CNN with only one hidden layer and an ad-hoc loss function was constructed involving two branches for processing spectral and image features of a brain voxel respectively. Each branch consists of a single convolutional hidden layer. The output of the two convolutional layers is merged and fed to a classification layer that outputs class predictions for the given brain voxel. Results: Our CNN method separated glioma grades 3 and 4 and identified Alzheimer’s disease patients using MRSI and complementary MRI data with high MCC score (Area Under the Curve were 0.87 and 0.91 respectively). The results demonstrated superior effectiveness over other popular methods as Partial Least Squares or Support Vector Machines. Also, our method automatically identified the spectral regions most important in the diagnosis process and we show that these are in good agreement with existing biomarkers from the literature. Conclusion: Shallow CNNs models integrating image and spectral features improved quantitative and exploration and diagnosis of brain diseases for research and clinical purposes.

For signal denoising, a novel non-negative matrix factorization screening empirical mode decomposition (NMFSEMD) and a fast orthogonal search (FOS)-based muscle force prediction model are developed. First, the NMFSEMD model is used to screen the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) results into the noisy intrinsic mode functions (IMF). Then, the noise matrix is computed using IMF translation and superposition, and the matrix is used as the input of NMF to obtain the denoised IMF. Furthermore, the reconstruction outcome of the NMFSEMD method can be used to estimate the denoised sEMG. Finally, a new sEMG muscle force prediction model, which considers a kind of candidate function in derivative form, is constructed, and a data-training-based linear weighted model is obtained. Extensive experimental results validate the suggested method’s correction: after the NMFSEMD denoising of raw sEMG signal, the signal-noise ratio (SNR) can be improved by about 15.0 dB, and the energy percentage (EP) can be greater than 90.0%. Comparing with the muscle force prediction models using the traditional pretreatment and LSSVM, and the NMFSEMD plus LSSVM-based method, the mean square error (MSE) of our approach can be reduced by at least 1.2%.\n']",academic:abstract,plos_scrapper.py,construction,20220928T101606,(abstract:construction) AND (injury OR safety OR health OR accident OR stress OR risk OR ohs) NOT (abstract:protein)

South American fur seals, Arctocephalus australis (SAFS) and sea lions Otaria byronia (SASL), coexist along the coasts of Peru. Recently, ocean warming events (2014–2017) that can decrease and impoverish prey biomass have occurred in the Peruvian Humboldt Current System. In this context, our aim was to assess the effect of warming events on long-term inter- and intra-specific niche segregation. We collected whisker from SAFS (55 females and 21 males) and SASL (14 females and 22 males) in Punta San Juan, Peru. We used δ13C and δ15N values serially archived in otariid whiskers to construct a monthly time series for 2005–2019. From the same period we used sea level anomaly records to determine shifts in the predominant oceanographic conditions using a change point analysis. Ellipse areas (SIBER) estimated niche width of species-sex groups and their overlap. We detected a shift in the environmental conditions marking two distinct periods (P1: January 2005—October 2013; P2: November 2013—December 2019). Reduction in δ15N in all groups during P2 suggests impoverished baseline values with bottom-up effects, a shift towards consuming lower trophic level prey, or both. Reduced overlap between all groups in P2 lends support of a more redundant assemblage during the colder P1 to a more trophically segregated assemblage during warmer P2. SASL females show the largest variation in response to the warming scenario (P2), reducing both ellipse area and δ15N mean values. Plasticity to adapt to changing environments and feeding on a more available food source without fishing pressure can be more advantageous for female SASL, albeit temporary trophic bottom-up effects. This helps explain larger population size of SASL in Peru, in contrast to the smaller and declining SAFS population.\n']",academic:abstract,plos_scrapper.py,construction,20220928T101606,(abstract:construction) AND (injury OR safety OR health OR accident OR stress OR risk OR ohs) NOT (abstract:protein)

Community structure may be determined by various processes, including differential responses of species to environmental characteristics, regional-level spatial influences such as dispersal, or stochasticity generated from ecological drift. Few studies have used the metacommunity paradigm (interacting communities linked by dispersal) to investigate avian community composition along an urban gradient, yet such a theoretical construct may provide insights into species turnover even in unnatural settings such as rural to urban gradients. We measured the influence of spatial and environmental characteristics on two aspects of avian community structure across a gradient of urbanization: 1) taxonomic composition and 2) functional richness based on diet, foraging strategies, nesting locations and morphology. We also measured the relationship between species traits and environmental variables with an RLQ-fourth corner analysis. Together, environmental and spatial processes were significantly related to taxonomic structure and functional richness, but spatial variables accounted for more variation than environmental variables. Fine spatial scales were positively correlated with insectivorous birds and negatively correlated with body and wing size. Urbanization was positively correlated with birds that forage at the canopy level, while emergent wetlands were negatively correlated with birds that nested in cliffs and frugivorous birds. Functional richness and urbanization were significantly related to fine spatial variables. Spatial and environmental factors played an important role in taxonomic and functional structure in avian metacommunity structure.

However, the limited information capacity of the zygotic genome puts a strong constraint on how, and which, axonal routes can be encoded. We propose and validate a mechanism of development that can provide an efficient encoding of this global wiring task. The key principle, confirmed through simulation, is that basic constraints on mitoses of neural stem cells—that mitotic daughters have similar gene expression to their parent and do not stray far from one another—induce a global hierarchical map of nested regions, each marked by the expression profile of its common progenitor population. Thus, a traversal of the lineal hierarchy generates a systematic sequence of expression profiles that traces a staged route, which growth cones can follow to their remote targets. We have analyzed gene expression data of developing and adult mouse brains published by the Allen Institute for Brain Science, and found them consistent with our simulations: gene expression indeed partitions the brain into a global spatial hierarchy of nested contiguous regions that is stable at least from embryonic day 11.5 to postnatal day 56. We use this experimental data to demonstrate that our axonal guidance algorithm is able to robustly extend arbors over long distances to specific targets, and that these connections result in a qualitatively plausible connectome. We conclude that, paradoxically, cell division may be the key to uniting the neurons of the brain.\nAuthor summary: The embryological development of each brain installs an essentially identical communication network between its cells that is roughly as complex as that between the billions of people living on Earth. Although vast scientific resources are currently applied to identifying the final pattern of connections, the connectome, there has until now been relatively little effort to answer the fundamental question of how this complex network across billions of neurons is realized through the mitotic elaboration of the initial embryonic cell. The problem is sharpened by the constraints that construction of the network is limited by the information budget of the initial genome, and that it has no pre-existing address space for placing neurons and guiding axons. We explain how Biology can solve this problem by using the family tree of neurons to install a global space of molecular addresses, which axons can use to navigate from their source neuron to its relatives. We provide experimental evidence for this familial address space in gene expression patterns of the developing mouse brain, and demonstrate through simulation that the experimentally observed address space indeed supports global navigation to produce a qualitatively plausible default connectome.

However, there is a gap in knowledge regarding how to facilitate ACP following acute illness in later life. Aim/Objectives: To explore the perceived impact of ACP on the lives of older persons aged 70+ who have been acutely admitted to hospital. Method: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with older adults aged 70+ who were admitted to hospital as an emergency. Thematic analysis was enhanced by dual coding and exploration of divergent views within an interdisciplinary team. Results: Twenty participants were interviewed. Thematic analysis generated the following themes: (1) Bespoke planning to holistically support a sense of self, (2) ACP as a socio-cultural phenomenon advocating for older persons rights, (3) The role of personal relationships, (4) Navigating unfamiliar territory and (5) Harnessing resources. Conclusion: These findings indicate that maintaining a sense of personal identity and protecting individuals’ wishes and rights during ACP is important to older adults who have been acutely unwell. Following emergency hospitalization, older persons believe that ACP must be supported by a network of relationships and resources, improving the likelihood of adequate preparation to navigate the uncertainties of future care in later life.

During the daytime, staff encouraged residents to eat well, and be physically active and stimulated to limit daytime sleep. In the evening, staff settled residents into dark, quiet, comfortable bedrooms often after a snack. When residents woke at night, they gave them caffeinated tea or food, considered possible pain and discomfort, and reassured residents they were safe. If residents remained unsettled, staff would engage them in activities. They used telecare to monitor night-time risk. Staff found minimising daytime napping difficult, described insufficient staffing at night to attend to reorient and guide awake residents and said residents frequently did not know it was night-time. Conclusions: Some common techniques, such as caffeinated drinks, may be counterproductive. Future non-pharmacological interventions should consider practical difficulties staff face in managing sleep disturbances, including struggling to limit daytime napping, identifying residents’ night-time needs, day-night disorientation, and insufficient night-time staffing.

88,PLOS ONE,2022-08-29T00:00:00Z,Social interactions and quality of life of residents in aged care facilities: A multi-methods study,"['Background: The relationship between social contact and quality of life is well-established within the general population. However, limited data exist about the extent of social interactions in residential aged care facilities (RACFs) providing long-term accommodation and care. We aimed to record the frequency and duration of interpersonal interactions among residents in RACFs and identify the association between residents’ interpersonal interactions and quality of life (QoL). Materials and methods: A multi-methods study, including time and motion observations and a QoL survey, was conducted between September 2019 to January 2020. Thirty-nine residents from six Australian RACFs were observed between 09:30–17:30 on weekdays. Observations included residents’ actions, location of the action, and who the resident was with during the action. At the end of the observation period, residents completed a QoL survey. The proportion of time residents spent on different actions, in which location, and with whom were calculated, and correlations between these factors and QoL were analysed. Results: A total of 312 hours of observations were conducted. Residents spent the greatest proportion of time in their own room (45.2%, 95%CI 40.7–49.8), alone (47.9%, 95%CI 43.0–52.7) and being inactive (25.6%, 95%CI 22.5–28.7). Residents were also largely engaged in interpersonal communication (20.2%, 95%CI 17.9–22.5) and self-initiated or scheduled events (20.5%, 95%CI 18.0–23.0). Residents’ interpersonal communication was most likely to occur in the common area (29.3%, 95%CI 22.9–35.7), residents’ own room (26.7%, 95%CI 21.0–32.4) or the dining room (24.6%, 95%CI 18.9–30.2), and was most likely with another resident (54.8%, 95%CI 45.7–64.2). Quality of life scores were low (median = 0.68, IQR = 0.54–0.76). Amount of time spent with other residents was positively correlated with QoL (r = 0.39, p = 0.02), whilst amount of time spent with facility staff was negatively correlated with QoL (r = -0.45, p = 0.008). Discussion and conclusions: Our findings confirm an established association between social interactions and improved QoL. Opportunities and activities which encourage residents to engage throughout the day in common facility areas can support resident wellbeing.

89,PLOS ONE,2022-09-01T00:00:00Z,It’s made a really hard situation even more difficult: The impact of COVID-19 on families of children with chronic illness,"['Objective: For over two years, the global COVID-19 pandemic has forced major transformations on health, social, and educational systems, with concomitant impacts on mental health. This study aimed to understand the unique and additional challenges faced by children with chronic illness and their families during the COVID-19 era. Method: Parents of children receiving treatment for a chronic illness within the neurology, cancer, renal and respiratory clinics of Sydney Children’s Hospital were invited to participate. We used qualitative methodology, including a semi-structured interview guide, verbatim transcription, and thematic analysis supported by QSR NVivo. Results: Thirteen parents of children receiving tertiary-level care, for nine chronic illnesses, participated. Parents reported intense fears relating to their ill child’s additional vulnerabilities, which included their risk of developing severe COVID-19 disease and the potential impact of COVID-19-related disruptions to accessing clinical care, medications, allied health support and daily care protocols should their parent contract COVID-19. Parents perceived telehealth as a highly convenient and preferred method for ongoing management of less complex healthcare needs. Parents reported that the accrual of additional stressors and responsibilities during the pandemic, experienced in combination with restricted social interaction and reduced access to usual support networks was detrimental to their own mental health. Hospital-based visitation restrictions reduced emotional support, coping, and resilience for both parents and children and in some cases led to marital discord, sibling distress, and financial loss. Supportive factors included increased time spent together at home during the pandemic and improved hygiene practices at school, which dramatically reduced the incidence of non-COVID-19-related communicable illnesses in chronically ill children. Discussion: For families caring for a chronically ill child, COVID-19 made a difficult situation harder. The pandemic has highlighted the need for targeted psychosocial intervention for vulnerable families, to mitigate current mental health burden and prevent chronic psychological distress.

90,PLOS ONE,2022-08-31T00:00:00Z,Comparative inequalities in child dental caries across four countries: Examination of international birth cohorts and implications for oral health policy,"['\nChild dental caries (i.e., cavities) are a major preventable health problem in most high-income countries. The aim of this study was to compare the extent of inequalities in child dental caries across four high-income countries alongside their child oral health policies. Coordinated analyses of data were conducted across four prospective population-based birth cohorts (Australia, n = 4085, born 2004; Québec, Canada, n = 1253, born 1997; Rotterdam, the Netherlands, n = 6690, born 2002; Southeast Sweden, n = 7445, born 1997), which enabled a high degree of harmonization. Risk ratios (adjusted) and slope indexes of inequality were estimated to quantify social gradients in child dental caries according to maternal education and household income. Children in the least advantaged quintile for income were at greater risk of caries, compared to the most advantaged quintile: Australia: AdjRR = 1.18, 95%CI = 1.04–1.34; Québec: AdjRR = 1.69, 95%CI = 1.36–2.10; Rotterdam: AdjRR = 1.67, 95%CI = 1.36–2.04; Southeast Sweden: AdjRR = 1.37, 95%CI = 1.10–1.71). There was a higher risk of caries for children of mothers with the lowest level of education, compared to the highest: Australia: AdjRR = 1.18, 95%CI = 1.01–1.38; Southeast Sweden: AdjRR = 2.31, 95%CI = 1.81–2.96; Rotterdam: AdjRR = 1.98, 95%CI = 1.71–2.30; Québec: AdjRR = 1.16, 95%CI = 0.98–1.37. The extent of inequalities varied in line with jurisdictional policies for provision of child oral health services and preventive public health measures. Clear gradients of social inequalities in child dental caries are evident in high-income countries. Policy related mechanisms may contribute to the differences in the extent of these inequalities. Lesser gradients in settings with combinations of universal dental coverage and/or fluoridation suggest these provisions may ameliorate inequalities through additional benefits for socio-economically disadvantaged groups of children.\n']",academic:abstract,plos_scrapper.py,aged_care,20220928T101606,"(everything:""aged care"") AND (injury OR safety OR health OR accident OR stress OR risk OR ohs)"
91,PLOS ONE,2022-08-02T00:00:00Z,Contemporary nutrition-based interventions to reduce risk of infection among elderly long-term care residents: A scoping review,"['Background: Elderly long-term care residents (ELTCRs) face considerable burden of infection, especially evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. The nutritional status of the host can influence susceptibility to infection by altering immune system integrity, therefore, nutrition-based interventions may be a viable complement to existing infection prevention measures. Objective: This scoping review sought to identify nutritional interventions and factors that have the strongest evidence to benefit ELTCRs, and thus best poised for rigorous clinical trial evaluation and subsequent implementation. Methods: A database search of OVID-Medline, OVID-Embase, and Web of Science was performed from 2011 to 2021 to identify nutritional intervention studies which attribute to changes in infection in contemporary ELTCR settings. Articles were screened in duplicate and data extraction completed by a single reviewer, while a second reviewer verified the data which was fitted to identify evidence for nutritional interventions related to reducing rates of infection among ELTCRs. Results: The search identified 1018 studies, of which 11 (nine clinical trials and two observational cohort studies) satisfied screening criteria. Interventions that significantly reduced risk of infection included whey protein (any infection), Black Chokeberry (urinary tract infection), and vitamin D (acute respiratory tract infection, skin and soft tissue infection). Both zinc and a dedicated meal-plan significantly improved lymphocyte parameters. Vitamin D deficiency was associated with the development of respiratory tract infections. Probiotic and soy-based protein interventions did not significantly affect risk of infection or lymphocyte parameters, respectively. Conclusion: The current scoping review was effective in identifying the use of nutrition-based interventions for infection prevention among ELTCRs. In this study, some nutrition-based interventions were observed to significantly influence the risk of infection among ELTCRs. Nutritional interventions such as vitamin D (preventing deficiency/insufficiency), Black Chokeberry juice, zinc gluconate, whey protein, and varied and nutrient dense meal plans may be suitable for future rigorous clinical trial evaluation.

92,PLOS ONE,2022-08-03T00:00:00Z,"Structural equation model of the relationship between functional ability, mental health, and quality of life in older adults living alone","['Aims: Living alone, a reality in an increasing number of older adults recently, is a risk factor for low quality of life. This study identified the predictors of quality of life in older adults living alone based on mental health and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health. Methods: This secondary data analysis used information from the 2018 Assessing the Requirements of Customized Health Care and Daily Living Support Services survey (N = 1,022), collected from adults aged ≥ 65 living alone in Siheung City, South Korea, from August to October 2018. The exogenous variables were body functions (hand grip strength, timed “up and go” test score, and body mass index), daily living activities (Korean Instrumental Activities of the Daily Living Scale), social activity participation (social activity engagement, neighbor contacts, and family contacts), and participation in economic activity (frequency). The endogenous variables were mental health (Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form—Korean Version and UCLA Loneliness Scale) and quality of life (EuroQoL-5 Dimension-3 Level and EuroQoL-Visual Analog Scale). Results: After modifying the hypothetical model, which had failed to satisfy the recommended fitness level, the (modified) model had good fitness indices Q (CMIN / df) 2.90, GFI 1, AGFI 1, RMSEA 0.04, CFI 0.90 and PCFI 0.53. Of the nine pathways of the modified model, five were statistically significant. Quality of life was affected by body functions, daily living activities, social activity participation, and mental health. These variables explained 68.2% of the factors affecting quality of life. Conclusions: By highlighting the role of mental health, this model provides a useful framework for improving the quality of life of older adults who live alone and function at various levels in the community. Focusing on advancing mental health through body functions, daily living activities, and social activity participation can improve quality of life.
