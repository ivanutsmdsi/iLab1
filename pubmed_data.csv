1,"Injury surveillance in construction: what is an ""injury"", anyway?",American journal of industrial medicine,"Background:                       Over the last decade, there has been a decline in injuries with days away from work in construction, associated with an increase in injuries with restricted work activity only.                  Methods:                       We abstracted demographics, diagnosis, cause-of-injury, and hospital discharge information for 481 workers from one large construction project treated in an urban Emergency Department (ED). The project safety team provided data on all injuries from this site, including first aid cases.                  Results:                       This site had fewer injuries with days away from work than expected from national rates. Two hundred and fifty-six injuries were reported on the OSHA log, and of those 93 entailed days away from work; 1,515 injuries were considered first aid/medical only. We used a sample of the data to estimate that the site classified as ""recordable"" 128 of the 481 ED-treated injuries from this site (27%).                  Conclusions:                       The pattern of injury varies depending on the subset of injuries examined. Lost time injuries, as reported in BLS data, record fewer lacerations and eye injuries, and more strains and sprains. No one surveillance system presents the full spectrum of occupational injury. Tracking all injuries allow early recognition of injury risks, and therefore can lead to more effective prevention."
2,Prioritizing occupational injury prevention in the construction industry: injury severity or absence?,Journal of safety research,"Problem:                       National occupational injury prevention goals often prioritize the reduction of serious injuries. This study analyzed whether this prioritization is credible in respect to lost-time injuries and short and long term work absence, and the implications this has for injury severity-based versus injury absence-based prevention approaches.                  Method:                       The data consisted of national and work-site specific injury and absence data from construction workers in Denmark, including workers from the Copenhagen Metro construction sites, during the period 2000-2001.                  Results and impact on industry and government:                       Absence length was significantly dependent on the type of injury. Sprains and strains were most prevalent and accounted for approximately one third of injuries and absence. Fractures accounted for one sixth of injuries and the greatest proportion of long-term absence. The results give credibility to the need for targeting sprains and strains in injury and absence prevention initiatives."
3,Buddies in bad times? the role of co-workers after a work-related injury,Journal of occupational rehabilitation,"Introduction:                       Co-workers can play an important role after a work-related injury. They can provide details about the circumstances of an accident, offer emotional support to the injured worker and help with job tasks upon a co-worker's return to work (RTW). Working with an injured co-worker, however, can also strain work relationships and increase workload. The purpose of this study was to determine the role that co-workers play after a work-related injury and during the RTW process in the unionized, electrical construction sector.                  Methods:                       We conducted two focus groups with injured electricians and union representatives. We also interviewed co-workers who had worked with someone who had been injured in the course of employment. We examined the role that co-workers can play after a work-related injury and some of the factors facilitating and hindering co-worker support.                  Results:                       The structure of work in the electrical sector-a focus on cost-cutting and competition, job insecurity, perceptions of ""different camps"" among co-workers, little modified work and poor formal communication-can impede co-worker support and contribute to making injured workers' experiences difficult. Management can play an important role in setting an example for how injured workers are regarded and treated.                  Conclusions:                       Future research should explore how workers can better be supported after a work-related injury and during the RTW process."
4,"Long workhours, work scheduling and work-related injuries among construction workers in the United States","Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health","Objectives:                       The objectives of this study were (i) to examine work scheduling in construction and (ii) to establish whether there is any connection between workhours and safety outcomes among construction workers.                  Methods:                       The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979 cohort (NLSY79), was used for the data analysis. Odds ratios were used to measure the risk of work-related injury in different worker groups.                  Results:                       The findings showed that (i) construction workers started work earlier, worked longer days and fewer weeks a year, and were more likely to hold multiple jobs and change jobs than their nonconstruction counterparts and (ii) long workhours and irregular work schedules were significantly associated with a higher work-related injury rate after control for possible confounders.                  Conclusion:                       The results provide evidence that overtime and irregular work scheduling have an adverse effect on worker safety."
5,A case-crossover study of heat exposure and injury risk among outdoor construction workers in Washington State,"Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health","Objectives The primary objective of this study was to assess the relationship between heat exposure and occupational traumatic injuries among construction workers. Methods We assessed the relationship between humidex, a measure of apparent temperature, and Washington State Fund workers' compensation injuries among outdoor construction workers using a case-crossover design with time-stratified referent selection. Warm month (March-October) adult outdoor construction traumatic injury claims from 2000-2012 were spatiotemporally joined with high-resolution meteorological data. We used conditional logistic regression with linear splines to assess the association between maximum daily humidex and injuries. Results There were 63 720 occupational traumatic injury claims in construction that met our eligibility criteria during the study period. The traumatic injury odds ratio (OR) was 1.005 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.003-1.007] per one °C change in humidex. In the spline analyses, we observed a nearly linear association of humidex with the risk of a traumatic injury. Effect estimates were higher among younger (18-24 years) and older (>54 years) workers, workers with lower extremity injuries, workers with less job experience, smaller employers, workers working in Western Washington, and time of injury before 12:30 hours, although CI of effect estimates overlapped in stratified analysis categories. Conclusions In this study of Washington outdoor construction workers, increasing maximum daily humidex was associated with increasing traumatic injury risk. Further work should explore mechanisms of the association between heat exposure and traumatic injuries. Injury prevention efforts targeted at construction should address heat-related risk factors. In addition, heat awareness campaigns should address outcomes beyond heat-related illness."
6,Effects of safety and health training on work-related injury among construction laborers,Journal of occupational and environmental medicine,"Objectives:                       This study was designed to evaluate the effects of safety and health training on work-related injury in the construction industry.                  Methods:                       Union health insurance records, union training records, and workers compensation data for 1993 and 1994 were analyzed for more than 8000 construction laborers in Washington State.                  Results:                       After controlling for demographic factors, laborers who received safety and health training during the study period were 12% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.75-1.02) less likely than nontrained laborers to file for workers compensation. Among workers 16 to 24 years old, training was associated with a 42% (95% CI = 0.35-0.95) reduction in claims.                  Conclusions:                       These findings provide evidence of the effectiveness of safety and health training in preventing occupational injuries among construction laborers, particularly among younger workers. However, the results cover only a limited time and the long-term effects remain unclear."
7,Predisposing factors influencing occupational injury among frontline building construction workers in Ghana,BMC research notes,"Objective:                       This study aims to examine the predisposing factors influencing occupational injuries among frontline construction workers in Ghana. A cross-sectional survey was carried out with 634 frontline construction workers in Kumasi metropolis of Ghana using a structured questionnaire. The study was conducted from December 2016 to June 2017 using a household-based approach. The respondents were selected through a two-stage sampling approach. A multivariate logistics regression model was employed to examine the association between risk factors and injury. Data was analyzed employing descriptive and inferential statistics with STATA version 14.                  Results:                       The study found an injury prevalence of 57.91% among the workers. Open Wounds (37.29%) and fractures (6.78%) were the common and least injuries recorded respectively. The proximal factors (age, sex of worker, income) and distal factors (e.g. work structure, trade specialization, working hours, job/task location, and monthly off days) were risk factors for occupational injuries among frontline construction workers. The study recommends that policymakers and occupational health experts should incorporate the proximal and distal factors in the design of injury prevention as well as management strategies."
8,Age Differences in Return-to-Work Following Injury: Understanding the Role of Age Dimensions Across Longitudinal Follow-up,Journal of occupational and environmental medicine,"Objectives:                       To examine the overall association between chronological age and return-to-work (RTW), and understand if existing data could be used to better understand the role of age-related dimensions (functional, psychosocial, organizational, life-stage) in explaining these associations.                  Methods:                       We used survey data from a prospective cohort of injured workers in Victoria, Australia. Path models examined the relationship between chronological age and RTW, and the proportion mediated via age dimensions.                  Results:                       Older chronological age was associated with non-RTW, although the pattern was not observed consistently across follow-up surveys. A proportion of the overall relationship between chronological age and non-RTW was explained by functional and life-stage age and RTW status at previous time points.                  Conclusions:                       Findings underscore the importance of moving beyond age measured only in chronological years, towards more complex conceptual and analytical models that recognize age as a multidimensional construct."
9,"Effectiveness of OSHA Outreach Training on carpenters' work-related injury rates, Washington State 2000-2008",American journal of industrial medicine,"Introduction:                       Despite the size and breadth of OSHA's Outreach Training program for construction, information on its impact on work-related injury rates is limited.                  Methods:                       In a 9-year dynamic cohort of 17,106 union carpenters in Washington State, the effectiveness of OSHA Outreach Training on workers' compensation claims rate was explored. Injury rates were calculated by training status overall and by carpenters' demographic and work characteristics using Poisson regression.                  Results:                       OSHA Outreach Training resulted in a 13% non-significant reduction in injury claims rates overall. The protective effect was more pronounced for carpenters in their apprenticeship years, drywall installers, and with increasing time since training.                  Conclusions:                       In line with these observed effects and prior research, it is unrealistic to expect OSHA Outreach Training alone to have large effects on union construction workers' injury rates. Standard construction industry practice should include hazard awareness and protection training, coupled with more efficient approaches to injury control. Am. J. Ind.

10,Safety walkarounds predict injury risk and reduce injury rates in the construction industry,American journal of industrial medicine,"Background:                       ""Safe Workplace""-a simplified and educational version of the Finnish building construction methodology involving safety walkarounds where a number of safety indicators are inspected and evaluated-is in widespread use in the Danish construction sector to evaluate physical safety standards proactively at construction work sites.                  Methods:                       Data from the construction of the Copenhagen Metro were analyzed to determine the method's ability to predict injury risk related to joint responsibilities and individual worker responsibilities.                  Results:                       A statistically significant association between the risk level as measured by the Safe Workplace methodology and injury risk was found. The relative risk of injury increased with the number of safety indicators violated and was elevated for safety indicators reflecting both individual and joint safety responsibility. The observed injury risk was not elevated in the post-safety walkaround period for safety indicators of individual responsibility, but the joint responsibility indicators retained an elevated injury risk level.                  Conclusions:                       The data support the hypothesis that safety walkarounds both predict and prevent injuries. Safety indicators of individual responsibility are more likely to be corrected than those of joint responsibility."
11,An analysis of permanent work disability among construction sheet metal workers,American journal of industrial medicine,"Background:                       Causes of permanent work disability in the sheet metal industry are not well characterized.                  Methods:                       Pension records were used to compare causes of disability among sheet metal workers and the U.S. working population. Subgroup analysis examined the major causes of sheet metal worker disability.                  Results:                       Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), circulatory disease, and injuries were leading causes of sheet metal worker disability (47.2%, 13.7%, 10.9% of awards, respectively). Award distribution differed from the U.S. working population (P < 0.0001); MSDs and injuries accounted for higher proportions of sheet metal worker awards, particularly at spine, shoulder, and knee.                  Conclusions:                       Higher proportions of awards caused by MSD or injury among sheet metal workers may reflect higher rates of work-related injuries and MSDs, a high likelihood of disability with construction work given the same impairment, or higher prevalence of other conditions in the general population. Prevention requires task-specific ergonomic innovations and proven participatory interventions."
12,"Injury rates, severity, and drug testing programs in small construction companies",Journal of safety research,"Problem:                       Construction work is hazardous and workers consistently rank in the top of all occupations and industries for illicit drug and heavy alcohol use.                  Methods:                       Drug-testing programs were classified into three categories: no program, pre-employment/post-accident, and pre-employment/post-accident/random/suspicion. We analyzed workers' compensation claims from 1,360 construction companies over a six-year period to assess the possible association of testing program with injury rate.                  Results:                       Compared to no program, results respectively were RR=0.85 (CI=0.72-1.0) and RR=0.97 (CI=0.86-1.10) for all injuries, and RR=0.78 (CI=0.60-1.03) and RR=1.01 (CI=0.86-1.19) for lost-time injuries. Variability of results was exhibited across trade and union status, among other categories.                  Summary:                       Drug-testing programs may be associated with lower, non-significant, injury rates in this population.                  Impact on industry:                       Drug-testing programs may be associated with lower injury rates, but care should be exercised to ensure accurate injury reporting, characterize underlying safety practices of a company, and to determine quality and consistency of testing."
13,Work injury rehabilitation and the tendency to return to work of workers with injuries in Mainland China,"Work (Reading, Mass.)","This paper aims to describe the current situation of the work injury rehabilitation system in China with its drawbacks, especially relating to the employment services for workers with injuries and bringing up the topic of the need for more work to attempt to construct a modern work injury occupational rehabilitation system: perfecting the administration mechanism of policy, establishing an occupational rehabilitation pattern with Chinese characteristics, establishing the socialization service network as the core of occupational rehabilitation and establishing a practical professional team and academic communication platform. These creative thoughts may shed light on the development of the work injury rehabilitation system as well as the return to work for workers with injuries in China."
14,Spinal cord injury in the work force,Canadian journal of surgery. Journal canadien de chirurgie,"Of 144 patients with spinal cord injury admitted to the Sunnybrook Medical Centre from 1974 to 1979, 25 (24 men) (17.4%) had sustained their injuries at work. The 25 patients ranged in age from 20 to 56 years, with more than half being in their third decade of life. Work-related spinal cord injury was more frequent in the thoracic region than spinal injuries from other causes. The injuries were generally severe, 24% of them being complete cord injuries (i.e., no sensory or motor function below the level of injury). The mean neurologic grade of these patients did not change substantially between the time of admission and discharge. The mortality was 8%. The pattern of spinal cord injury in this series was compared to that in the period 1948 to 1973, when 105 (29.3%) of 358 spinal cord injuries occurred at work, constituting the second most frequent cause of acute spinal cord injury, after traffic accidents. In the current series, only 17.4% sustained their injuries at work. This was the third most common cause of spinal injuries in this period after traffic accidents and sports-recreational injuries. Falls in industry were the most frequent mode of work injury from 1974 to 1979, compared with construction accidents in the earlier period. The number of work-related spinal cord injuries is still too high. Furthermore, the severe neurologic damage suffered and the lack of substantial improvement emphasize the importance of preventive efforts, especially in industry. The fact that work injuries now rank third as a relative cause of spinal injury may indicate an absolute decline in this type of injury, especially among construction workers."
15,Medical Emergencies in Farmers,The Journal of rural health : official journal of the American Rural Health Association and the National Rural Health Care Association,"Background:                       Agricultural work involves hazards that may harm long-term well-being. We evaluated the risk of long-term disability and death for agricultural workers compared to construction workers with similar demographics. We hypothesized that delays to emergency care and subsequent long-term disability following injury might be worse for agricultural workers compared to those injured in construction.                  Methods:                       We evaluated all adults severely injured on farms or on construction sites in Ontario, Canada, between April 1, 2009, and March 31, 2012, according to the Ontario Trauma Registry. We excluded individuals living outside of the province, those missing a valid health card number, or youth less than 17 years old. Our primary outcome was death or the subsequent application for disability support.                  Results:                       In total, 353 patients were injured on a farm or construction site during the study period. Delays to emergency care exceeding 12 hours were more frequent for agricultural workers compared to construction workers (43% vs 23%, P <.001). After a 5-year follow-up, agricultural workers had a death or disability rate marginally higher than construction workers (23% vs 14%, P = .068), equivalent to a hazard ratio of 1.62 that was marginally statistically significant (95% confidence interval 0.96-2.75, P = .072). The risk of death and disability was greatest for patients who had the longest delays to emergency care.                  Interpretation:                       Agricultural workers experience a substantial delay in receiving emergency care and a marginally higher risk of death or disability in the years following injury compared to construction workers."
16,Twenty years of work-related injury and illness among union carpenters in Washington State,American journal of industrial medicine,"Background:                       Individuals who work in the construction industry are at high risk of occupational injury. Robust surveillance systems are needed to monitor the experiences of these workers over time.                  Methods:                       We updated important surveillance data for a unique occupational cohort of union construction workers to provide information on long-term trends in their reported work-related injuries and conditions. Combining administrative data sources, we identified a dynamic cohort of union carpenters who worked in Washington State from 1989 through 2008, their hours worked by month, and their workers' compensation claims. Incidence rates of reported work-related injuries and illnesses were examined. Poisson regression was used to assess risk by categories of age, gender, time in the union, and calendar time contrasting medical only and paid lost time claims.                  Results:                       Over the 20-year study period, 24,830 carpenters worked 192.4 million work hours. Work-related injuries resulting in medical care or paid lost time (PLT) from work occurred at a rate of 24.3 per 200,000 hr worked (95% CI: 23.5-25.0). Medical only claims declined 62% and PLT claims declined 77%; more substantive declines were seen for injuries resulting from being struck and falls to a lower level than from overexertion with lifting. Differences in risk based on union tenure and age diminished over time as well.                  Conclusions:                       Significant declines in rates of reported work-related injuries and illnesses were observed over the 20-year period among these union carpenters. Greater declines were observed among workers with less union tenure and for claims resulting in PLT."
17,Injury hazards in the construction industry,Journal of occupational medicine. : official publication of the Industrial Medical Association,"Although many occupational injury studies have been conducted on the construction industry, fatal injuries and lost work time injuries in this industry continue to rank among the highest in the nation. This paper presents an analysis of nonfatal (1981 through 1986) and fatal (1980 through 1989) traumatic occupational injuries in the construction industry using the Supplementary Data System and the National Traumatic Occupational Fatalities data bases. The lost workday case rate in construction was 10.1 per 100 full-time workers, which was nearly 2.5 times the occupational injury rate for all industries combined. The construction industry had an overall fatality rate of 25.6 per 100,000 full-time workers. This rate was more than 3.5 times the occupational fatality rate for all industries in the United States for the same period. To prevent occupational injuries and fatalities in the construction industry, intervention measures need to target specific occupations: machine operators, transportation workers, and crafts-people. Intervention measures also need to target such causes of injury as falls, electrocutions, and motor vehicle incidents."
18,Contingent workers,AAOHN journal : official journal of the American Association of Occupational Health Nurses,"Contingent workers compose a large portion of the U.S. work force. Contingent workers include temporary employees, contracted employees, day laborers, and freelancers. The skill level and educational requirements for their jobs vary from basic to highly advanced. Construction, housekeeping, engineering, and nursing have such positions. U.S. contingent workers are more likely to engage in occupations associated with increased risk of injury, and a variety of factors increase their risk of work injuries, particularly those leading to death. This article focuses on select occupational health and safety issues affecting contingent workers and their implications for occupational health nurses."
19,Occupational fatalities in Jordan,Journal of forensic and legal medicine,"Objective:                       Occupational fatalities are a worldwide problem. Certain occupations pose a greater risk than others. Recent statistics on global occupational injuries and diseases that might lead to temporary or permanent disability and even worse might lead to death, are staggering. The purpose of this study was to estimate the death rates from occupational injuries in Jordan over a period of four years; to estimate occupational fatality rate that results from accidental injuries and identify the most risky concurrent occupations with the type of injuries, the age and nationality of the victims.                  Method:                       A total of 88 work related fatalities were admitted to three hospitals in Amman through 2008-2012 and were examined by a forensic (occupational) physician at the time. They were categorized according to, age, nationality, occupation, type of injury and were all tested for toxic substances.                  Results:                       The occupation with the most fatalities was construction (44%); falling from a height was the commonest type of accident (44%) and head injuries were the leading injury type (21.6%); 9.1% of the deaths were positive for alcohol. Moreover, 22.7% of deaths were between ages of 25-29. Consequently, the mean occupational fatality rate was 2 per 100.000 workers during 2008-2012.                  Conclusion:                       Constructions and other types of occupations are more extensive problems than what is usually anticipated, especially when safety precautions are not effective or implemented. They may cause injuries and death, which will have a socioeconomic burden on families, society, governments and industries. Not to mention the grief that is associated with the death of a worker at his work site to all concerned parties."
20,Preventing construction worker injury incidents through the management of personal stress and organizational stressors,Accident; analysis and prevention,"Construction workers (CWs) are positioned at the lowest level of an organization and thus have limited control over their work. For this reason, they are often deprived of their due rewards and training or sometimes are even compelled to focus on production at the expense of their own safety. These organizational stressors not only cause the CWs stress but also impair their safety behaviors. The impairment of safety behaviors is the major cause of CW injury incidents. Hence, to prevent injury incidents and enhance safety behaviors of CWs, the current study aimed to identify the impact of various organizational stressors and stress on CW safety behaviors and injury incidents. To achieve this aim, we surveyed 395 CWs. Using factor analysis, we identified five organizational stressors (unfair reward and treatment, inappropriate safety equipment, provision of training, lack of goal setting, and poor physical environment), two types of stress (emotional and physical), and safety behaviors. The results of correlation and regression analyses revealed the following: (1) injury incidents were minimized by safety behaviors but escalated by a lack of goal setting, (2) safety behaviors were maximized by moderate levels of emotional stress (i.e., an inverted U-shape relationship between these two variables) and increased in line with physical stress and inappropriate safety equipment, (3) emotional stress was positively predicted by the provision of training and inappropriate safety equipment, and (4) physical stress was predicted only by inappropriate safety equipment. Based on these results, we suggest various recommendations to construction stakeholders on how to prevent CW injury incidents."
