1,The rodeo athlete: sport science: part I,"Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)",2010 May 1,,"Based on the tradition, history and lore of the American West, as well as the individualistic nature and lifestyle of the sport of rodeo, the rodeo athlete has achieved iconic status in sport, literature, art and entertainment. For over half a century, rodeo has become a staple of organized sport programmes in high schools, universities and international competitions. The origins of rodeo grew from ranch work dating back to the Spanish vaqueros in the 1700s. The sport was officially organized in 1929 and, by the 1930s, championships were determined and the sport of rodeo surpassed baseball and auto racing in spectator attendance. Since then, sponsorship has grown, resulting in extensive worldwide popularity through major media outlets. Despite growing popularity, few investigations exist regarding the scientific aspects of the sport. Rodeo competition is an activity that is basically intermittent in nature, with short periods of highly intense activity. When considering that experience and, thus, improvement in rodeo is achieved solely through constant and punishing practices involving actual and repetitive, human versus livestock competition, the practices closely imitate a sport-specific form of interval training. Studies, which address the anthropometric and performance characteristics of rodeo competitors, reveal that they are comparable to athletes in more traditional sports. The psychological constructs conducive to performance in rodeo have been varied and limited, with most research efforts focused on personality characteristics, sensation seeking and competitive anxiety. Nevertheless, when evaluated relative to higher levels of traditional sport performance, rodeo participants closely resemble their mainstream counterparts. Although efforts to quantify this non-traditional sport are still in the initial stages, information concerning what the optimal fitness level of rodeo athletes should be for maximal performance levels, in a basically anaerobic sport, remains to be determined and is an area for future study. Rodeo performance, as with all sports, is based on a multifactorial array of variables and, therefore, interdisciplinary efforts encompassing expertise across medicine, science and coaching are encouraged. Taking a comprehensive approach in the assessment of athletes, as well as the development and quantification of event-specific training protocols, may ultimately enhance athletic potential, minimize opportunity for injury and possibly provide information to coaches and allied health professionals for the appropriate development and optimal medical care of these athletes."
2,"Utilization of personal protective equipment and associated factors among building construction workers in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 2019",BMC public health,2020 May 27,,"Background:                       Personal protective equipment (PPE) is a material, device, equipment, or clothing used or worn by workers to reduce their chance of exposure or contact with any harmful material or energy that causes injury, disease, or even death. The use of PPE is a universal legal requirement to reduce occupational injuries and illnesses in the workplace. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess PPE utilization and its associated factors among building construction workers in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 2019.                  Methods:                       Institution based quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted on the selected construction sites of Addis Ababa city from April 1 to May 18, 2019. Data were collected among all (206) building construction workers via interviewer-administered questionnaires. Data were entered into Epi info version 7.1 and exported to SPSS version 25 statistical software for analysis. Variables with a p-value of less than 0.20 in bivariate analysis were included in multivariate logistic regression. Finally, variables with a p-value of less than 0.05 in multivariate analysis were considered as significantly associated.                  Results:                       The utilization of at least one PPE among building construction workers in Addis Ababa was found to be 38%. The majority (41.1%) of the participants' reason for not using PPE were the unavailability of PPE followed by absence of orientation on using PPE (21.3%). The majority (35.3%) and (32.2%) of participants knew abrasion as a type of injury and suffered from abrasion respectively. Factors associated with utilization of PPE were the presence of training on PPE use (AOR = 4.8; 95% CI: 2.3, 10.3), presence of safety training (AOR = 2,8; 95% CI:1.5, 5.2), safety orientation before commencing work (AOR = 4.0; 95% CI:1.9, 9.0) and presence of supervision (AOR = 5.0; 95% CI:1.9,13).                  Conclusions:                       PPE utilization among building construction workers in Addis Ababa was low. The main reasons for non-utilization of PPE were unavailability of the materials and the absence of orientation on using PPE. The presence of PPE use training, presence of safety training, safety orientation, and governmental supervision were factors associated with PPE utilization. There should be continuous supervision of construction sites to assure all workers get material and training on how to use it."
3,Preventive Effects of Safety Helmets on Traumatic Brain Injury after Work-Related Falls,International journal of environmental research and public health,2016 Oct 29,,"Introduction:                       Work-related traumatic brain injury (TBI) caused by falls is a catastrophic event that leads to disabilities and high socio-medical costs. This study aimed to measure the magnitude of the preventive effect of safety helmets on clinical outcomes and to compare the effect across different heights of fall.                  Methods:                       We collected a nationwide, prospective database of work-related injury patients who visited the 10 emergency departments between July 2010 and October 2012. All of the adult patients who experienced work-related fall injuries were eligible, excluding cases with unknown safety helmet use and height of fall. Primary and secondary endpoints were intracranial injury and in-hospital mortality. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of safety helmet use and height of fall for study outcomes, and adjusted for any potential confounders.                  Results:                       A total of 1298 patients who suffered from work-related fall injuries were enrolled. The industrial or construction area was the most common place of fall injury occurrence, and 45.0% were wearing safety helmets at the time of fall injuries. The safety helmet group was less likely to have intracranial injury comparing with the no safety helmet group (the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) (95% confidence interval (CI)): 0.42 (0.24-0.73)), however, there was no statistical difference of in-hospital mortality between two groups (the adjusted ORs (95% CI): 0.83 (0.34-2.03). In the interaction analysis, preventive effects of safety helmet on intracranial injury were significant within 4 m height of fall.                  Conclusions:                       A safety helmet is associated with prevention of intracranial injury resulting from work-related fall and the effect is preserved within 4 m height of fall. Therefore, wearing a safety helmet can be an intervention for protecting fall-related intracranial injury in the workplace."
4,The effects of sleep on workplace cognitive failure and safety,Journal of occupational health psychology,2019 Aug,,"Healthy employee sleep is important for occupational safety, but the mechanisms that explain the relationships among sleep and safety-related behaviors remain unknown. We draw from Crain, Brossoit, and Fisher's (in press) work, nonwork, and sleep (WNS) framework and Barnes' (2012) model of sleep and self-regulation in organizations to investigate the influence of construction workers' self-reported sleep quantity (i.e., duration) and quality (i.e., feeling well-rest upon awakening, ability to fall asleep and remain asleep) on workplace cognitive failures (i.e., lapses in attention, memory, and action at work) and subsequent workplace safety behaviors (i.e., safety compliance and safety participation) and reports of minor injuries. Construction workers from two public works agencies completed surveys at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Our results suggest that workers with more insomnia symptoms on average reported engaging in fewer required and voluntary safety behaviors and were at a greater risk for workplace injuries. These effects were mediated by workplace cognitive failures. In addition, workers with greater sleep insufficiency on average reported lower safety compliance, but this effect was not mediated by workplace cognitive failures. These results have implications for future workplace interventions, suggesting that organizations striving to improve safety should prioritize interventions that will reduce workers' insomnia symptoms and improve their ability to quickly fall asleep and stay asleep throughout the night.

5,A review of the revised Functional Capacity Index as a predictor of 12 month outcomes following injury,Injury,2017 Mar,,"The measurement of functional outcomes following severe trauma has been widely recognised as a priority for countries with developed trauma systems. In this respect, the Functional Capacity Index (FCI), a multi-attribute index which has been incorporated into the most recent Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) dictionary, is potentially attractive as it offers 12-month functional outcome predictions for patients captured by existing AIS-coded datasets. This review paper outlines the development, construction and validation of the predictive form of the FCI (termed the pFCI), the modifications made which produced the currently available 'revised' pFCI, and the extent to which the revised pFCI has been validated and used. The original pFCI performed poorly in validation studies. The revised pFCI does not address many of the identified limitations of the original version, and despite the ready availability of a truncated version in the AIS dictionary, it has only been used in a handful of studies since its introduction several years ago. Additionally, there is little evidence for its validity. It is suggested that the pFCI should be better validated, whether in the narrow population group of young, healthy individuals for which it was developed, or in the wider population of severely injured patients. Methods for accounting for the presence of multiple injures (of which two have currently been used) should also be evaluated. Many factors other than anatomical injury are known to affect functional outcomes following trauma. However, it is intuitive that any model which attempts to predict the ongoing morbidity burden in a trauma population should consider the effects of the injuries sustained. Although the revised pFCI potentially offers a low-cost assessment of likely functional limitations resulting from anatomical injury, it must be more rigorously evaluated before more comprehensive predictive tools can be developed from it."
6,Trauma caused by falling objects at construction sites,The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,2012 Sep,,"Background:                       Workplace-related injuries carry a significant health care challenge. The state of Qatar is developing rapidly, with much construction and an expanding industrial work force. This study aimed to assess the incidence and social impact of work-related injuries requiring hospitalization caused by falling objects at the construction sites.                  Methods:                       We performed a prospective study for all admissions, which resulted from falling objects between January 2008 and June 2010 at the only trauma center in the state of Qatar. Data were analyzed, and outcomes were described (mortality, length of hospital stay, and safety measures).                  Results:                       Of the total injured patients (N = 4,302) admitted between January 2008 and June 2010, 185 (4%) had injuries caused purely by falling objects. Patients' mean age was 29 years, and 97% of the patients were men. All injuries occurred at construction sites. Most patients (86%) were brought by ambulance, and the reminder was brought by private vehicles. After initial evaluation and resuscitation, 120 patients (65%) were found to have a single-system injury, and 65 (35%) had multisystem injury. Operative interventions were required in 50% of the patients. Mean length of hospital stay varied from 6.5 days for single-system injuries to 19 days for multisystem injuries. Safety devices were used in 32 patients (17.3%). All of the 16 mortality cases (8.6%) were reported in multiple injuries.                  Conclusion:                       Traumatic injury caused by falling object represents a significant problem in a rapidly developing country. Many of these injuries could be prevented by following established safety guidelines.                  Level of evidence:                       Epidemiologic study, level III."
7,Comprehensive movement system screening tool (MSST) for athletes: Development and measurement properties,Brazilian journal of physical therapy,2020 Nov-Dec,,"Objectives:                       Non-traumatic extremity injuries are particularly common in sports, representing a significant economic, academic, and psychosocial burden on athletes. Proposed musculoskeletal risk factors for increased injury and decreased performance in athletes include movement pattern inefficiency, decreased regional stability, decreased mobility, and asymmetrical movement. The Movement System Screening Tool (MSST) is a comprehensive screening tool designed to assess these factors. Thus, the purpose of this study was to describe the development and determine the content and construct validity and inter-rater reliability of the MSST.                  Methods:                       A modified Delphi panel of experts determined content validity. 80 athletes (40 with and 40 without a current non-traumatic shoulder injury) completed 21 clinical tests, with exploratory factor analysis and known group analysis performed to determine construct validity. Two independent raters were used to establish individual item and composite score inter-rater reliability.                  Results:                       Exploratory factor analysis identified three of the four apriori constructs over 7 factors (14 tests), representing 63% of the variance. Known group analysis revealed a significantly lower composite score in athletes with vs. without a current non-traumatic shoulder injury (56.9±5.8 vs. 62.7±4.5, respectively). A preliminary cut score of 62 was chosen with sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 44%. Composite score inter-rater reliability was excellent ICC (2,1)=0.94, 95% CI (0.91, 0.96) and item reliability ranged from κ=.57 to 1.00.                  Conclusions:                       The MSST possesses constructs representative of injury risk and measurement properties acceptable for use in clinical settings. Comprehensive screens with construct validity and known measurement error are needed not only to identify athletes at risk of injury, but also provide an instrument that can be used in studies that seek to validate training approaches proposed to change movement impairment and injury risk in athletes."
8,Routine systemic antibiotic prophylaxis for burn injuries in developing countries: A best evidence topic (BET),"International journal of surgery (London, England)",2015 Sep,,"Background:                       Burns are common in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and complicated by unhygienic conditions, malnutrition, use of high-risk homemade dressings and delayed presentation. Resultantly, use of routine systemic antibiotic prophylaxis (SAP) to prevent wound infection is common practice despite this intervention being abandoned in high-income countries due to increased antimicrobial resistance and non-bacterial suprainfection.                  Methods:                       A best evidence topic (BET) was constructed using a structured protocol. The question addressed was: In LMICs, does routine use of SAP reduce burn wound infection, morbidity or mortality?                  Results:                       From 704 retrieved records, 48 reports met criteria to be examined. Of those, 3 studies represented the best available evidence. Together, two randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and a retrospective cohort study reported no difference in the proportion of wound infection, any infection or length of hospital stay between SAP groups and controls. One RCT described a greater proportion of wounds infected with P. aeruginosa among SAP arms compared to controls. The studies had few participants and significant methodological weaknesses.                  Conclusion:                       On the basis of limited, currently available evidence, the use of SAP cannot be recommended for patients in LMICs that present soon after burn injury."
9,"Construction accidents: identification of the main associations between causes, mechanisms and stages of the construction process",International journal of occupational safety and ergonomics : JOSE,2017 Jun,,Objective:                       To identify the most frequent causes of accidents in the construction sector in order to help safety practitioners in the task of prioritizing preventive actions depending on the stage of construction.                  Methods:                       Official accident investigation reports are analysed. A causation pattern is identified with the proportion of causes in each of the different possible groups of causes.                  Results:                       Significant associations of the types of causes with accident mechanisms and construction stages have been identified.                  Conclusions:                       Significant differences have been found in accident causation depending on the mechanism of the accident and the construction stage ongoing. These results should be used to prioritize preventive actions to combat the most likely causes for each accident mechanism and construction stage.
10,Cause and incidence of injuries experienced by children in remote Cape York Indigenous communities,Australian journal of primary health,2019 Apr,,"Indigenous children experience a disproportionally high number of injuries, particularly in remote communities. This study aimed to investigate: (1) the causes of injury to children within three remote Indigenous communities of Cape York, Australia; (2) differences between communities; and (3) if strengthening of alcohol restrictions reduced the incidence of injury. An injury profile for children aged 0-14 years was constructed for the period 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2011 using clinical file audit data from Primary Health Care Clinics located in each community. Children aged <14 years were responsible for 1461 injury presentations among 563 individuals. Males were responsible for 58.7% of presentations and 38% (n = 214) of children presented on three or more occasions. The leading causes of injury were falls (including sports); cutting and piercing; animals, insects and plants; transport and assault. There were variations in the order of major injury causes across the three communities. As primary causes of injury, falls and transport-related injuries aligned with other child populations. Cutting and piercing; animals, insects and plants; and assault-related injuries were more prevalent compared with other child populations. There was a significant difference in injury rates between communities and no significant difference before and after the strengthening of alcohol restrictions."
11,"Skin Cancer Prevention Behaviors Among Agricultural and Construction Workers in the United States, 2015",Preventing chronic disease,2019 Feb 7,,"Introduction:                       Nearly 5 million people are treated for skin cancer each year in the United States. Agricultural and construction workers (ACWs) may be at increased risk for skin cancer because of high levels of ultraviolet radiation exposure from the sun. This is the first study that uses nationally representative data to assess sun-protection behaviors among ACWs.                  Methods:                       We analyzed data from the 2015 National Health Interview Survey Cancer Control Supplement to examine the prevalence of sun-protection behaviors among ACWs. We calculated national, weighted, self-reported prevalence estimates. We used χ2 tests to assess differences between ACWs by industry and occupation.                  Results:                       Most of the 2,298 agricultural and construction workers studied were male (by industry, 72.4% in agriculture and 89.3% in construction; by occupation, 66.1% in agriculture and 95.6% in construction) and non-Hispanic white. About one-third had at least 1 sunburn in the past year. The prevalence of sunscreen use and shade seeking was low and did not significantly differ among groups, ranging from 15.1% to 21.4% for sunscreen use and 24.5% to 29.1% for shade seeking. The prevalence of wearing protective clothing was significantly higher among agricultural workers than among construction workers by industry (70.9% vs 50.7%) and occupation (70.5% vs 53.0%).                  Conclusion:                       Our findings could be used to improve occupational health approaches to reducing skin cancer risk among ACWs and to inform education and prevention initiatives addressing skin cancer. Sun-safety initiatives may include modifying work sites to increase shade and adding sun safety to workplace policies and training. Employers can help reduce occupational health inequities and protect workers by creating workplaces that facilitate sun protection."
12,Communication of Ergonomics in building and construction,"Work (Reading, Mass.)",2012,,"For the coming years SWEA is planning for communication and information actions. One of the sectors concerned is the building and construction industry. Focus of the information is to avoid accidents and injuries, and how companies by themselves can prevent risks. The objective of the information is to increase awareness among all stakeholders in order to secure that they are willing and able to reduce risks for workers. At the conference two brochures will be presented. They are designed to provide information and knowledge about specific risks of occupational accidents and occupational diseases which occur frequently during construction work and how they can be prevented. They are directed to all those who are involved in the construction process at different stages and who are subject to SWEAs rules and regulations. New identified risk groups are e.g. students, apprentices, self-employed, and foreign workers temporarily working in Sweden. We also see that work is still being carried out in narrow installation spaces during erection stage of buildings because the people responsible for the drawings do not take notice of the need for sufficient space to do the work. SWEA experienced that it is difficult to reach all the groups concerned with the message about how to avoid injuries and unnecessary musculoskeletal disorders."
13,Upper-Extremity Physical-Performance Tests in College Athletes,Journal of sport rehabilitation,2016 May,,"Context:                       Physical-performance tests (PPTs) are commonly used in rehabilitation and injury-prevention settings, yet normative values of upper-extremity PPTs have not been established in high-level athletes.                  Objective:                       To establish normative data values for the Closed Kinetic Chain Upper-Extremity Stability Test (CKCUEST) and Upper-Quarter Y-Balance Test (UQYBT) in college athletes and compare results between sports and to analyze the relationship between the 2 tests.                  Design:                       Observational.                  Setting:                       Laboratory/athletic facility.                  Participants:                       257 (118 male, 139 female) Division I athletes participating in basketball, soccer, baseball, lacrosse, volleyball, track and field, and cross-country.                  Intervention:                       CKCUEST and UQYBT scores were recorded as part of a comprehensive injury-risk screening battery.                  Main outcome measure:                       Pearson correlations assessed the relationship between all measures of the CKCUEST and UQYBT. A factorial ANOVA and a repeated-measures ANOVA (arm dominance) were used to assess interactions between sex, year in school, and sport for CKCUEST and UQYBT scores.                  Results:                       Normative values for the CKCUEST and UQYBT were established for 9 men's and women's college sports. No significant relationships were found between PPT scores. Men scored significantly higher than women for the CKCUEST (P = .002) and UQYBT (P = .010). Baseball players scored significantly higher than athletes from all other sports for the UQYBT (P < .001) but showed nonsignificant trends of lower scores for the CKCUEST than lower-extremity-dominant athletes such as runners (P = .063) and lacrosse players (P = .058).                  Conclusions:                       Results suggest that average CKCUEST and UQYBT scores in Division I athletes are distinct from those previously reported in recreationally active populations and that performance differences exist between sexes and sports. In addition, the CKCUEST and UQYBT appear to measure different constructs of performance and may complement each other as part of a screening battery."
14,Are regulations effective in reducing construction injuries? An analysis of the Italian context,Occupational and environmental medicine,2013 Sep,,"Objectives:                       At the end of the 1990s, as required by European Directive 92/57/EEC, two laws were enacted in Italy which laid down safety and health requirements for construction sites: Decree 494/96 and Decree 528/99. The aim is to evaluate the impact on injury rates due to actions performed by a group of eight regions that planned formalised programmes to enforce the laws around the year 2000.                  Methods:                       Using the Work History Italian Panel-Salute integrated database, which extends from 1994 to 2005, total and serious injury rates were calculated for the construction sector. An interrupted time series analysis was applied to serious injury rates.                  Results:                       During the 12 years under observation, at the national level the total and serious injury rates decreased while the number of employees increased. The results of the regression models indicate that in the period after the intervention the injury rates (×10 000 weeks worked) decreased by 0.21 per year more than in the period before the intervention (CI -0.41 to -0.01). The difference in pre-post trends is even larger after adjusting for external factors.                  Conclusions:                       The intervention plans developed to enforce the two Italian decrees had an effect on the reduction in injury rates. The results showed that there was a decrease in injury rates that could not be explained by external factors. These findings highlight the importance of concrete initiatives to have employers and workers comply with regulatory safety standards."
15,Detecting destabilizing wheelchair conditions for maintaining seated posture,Disability and rehabilitation. Assistive technology,2018 Feb,,"Purpose:                       The purpose of this study was to detect and classify potentially destabilizing conditions encountered by manual wheelchair users with spinal cord injuries (SCI) to dynamically increase stability and prevent falls.                  Methods:                       A volunteer with motor complete T11 paraplegia repeatedly propelled his manual wheelchair over level ground and simulated destabilizing conditions including sudden stops, bumps and rough terrain. Wireless inertial measurement units attached to the wheelchair frame and his sternum recorded associated accelerations and angular velocities. Algorithms based on mean, standard deviation and minimum Mahalanobis distance between conditions were constructed and applied to the data off-line to discriminate between events. Classification accuracy was computed to assess effects of sensor position and potential for automatically selecting a dynamic intervention to best stabilize the wheelchair user.                  Results:                       The decision algorithm based on acceleration signals successfully differentiated destabilizing conditions and level over-ground propulsion with classification accuracies of 95.8, 58.3 and 91.7% for the chest, wheelchair and both sensors, respectively.                  Conclusion:                       Mahalanobis distance classification based on trunk accelerations is a feasible method for detecting destabilizing events encountered by wheelchair users and may serve as an effective trigger for protective interventions. Incorporating data from wheelchair-mounted sensors decreases the false negative rate. Implications for Rehabilitation SCI has a significant impact on quality of life, compromising the ability to participate in social or leisure activities, and complete other activities of daily living for an independent lifestyle. Using inertial measurement units to build an event classifier for control the actions of a neuroprosthetic device for maintaining seated posture in wheelchair users. Varying muscle activation increases user stability reducing the risk of injury."
16,Psychometric properties of the psychosocial screening instrument for physical trauma patients (PSIT),Health and quality of life outcomes,2019 Nov 12,,"Background:                       Early detection of psychosocial problems post-injury may prevent them from becoming chronic. Currently, there is no psychosocial screening instrument that can be used in patients surviving a physical trauma or injury. Therefore, we recently developed a psychosocial screening instrument for adult physical trauma patients, the PSIT. The aim of this study was to finalize and psychometrically examine the PSIT.                  Methods:                       All adult (≥ 18 years) trauma patients admitted to a Dutch level I trauma center from October 2016 through September 2017 without severe cognitive disorders (n = 1448) received the PSIT, Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-State (STAI-S), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life-Abbreviated version (WHOQOL-Bref). After 2 weeks, a subgroup of responding participants received the PSIT a second time. The internal structure (principal components analysis, PCA; and confirmatory factor analysis, CFA), internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha, α), test-retest reliability (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient, ICC), construct validity (Spearman's rho correlations), diagnostic accuracy (Area Under the Curve, AUC), and potential cut-off values (sensitivity and specificity) were examined.                  Results:                       A total of 364 (25.1%) patients participated, of whom 128 completed the PSIT again after 19.5 ± 6.8 days. Test-retest reliability was good (ICC = 0.86). Based on PCA, five items were removed because of cross-loadings ≥ 0.3. Three subscales were identified: (1) Negative affect (7 items; α = 0.91; AUC = 0.92); (2) Anxiety and Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms (4 items; α = 0.77; AUC = 0.88); and (3) Social and self-image (4 items; α = 0.79; AUC = 0.92). CFA supported this structure (comparative fit index = 0.96; root mean square error of approximation = 0.06; standardized rood mean square residual = 0.04). Four of the five a priori formulated hypotheses regarding construct validity were confirmed. The following cut-off values represent maximum sensitivity and specificity: 7 on subscale 1 (89.6% and 83.4%), 3 on subscale 2 (94.4% and 90.3%), and 4 on subscale 3 (85.7% and 90.7%).                  Conclusion:                       The final PSIT has good psychometric properties in adult trauma patients."
17,Rural-urban differences in children’s musculosceletal injuries in north-eastern Poland,Przeglad epidemiologiczny,2019,,"Objective:                       To investigate rural-urban differences in severity of injuries, by means of age, sex and duration of hospitalization of injured children in northeastern Poland.                  Methods:                       The study included children admitted to the Department of Pediatric Orthopaedics and Traumatology in between 2002-2005 (1322 patients) and 2012-2013 (1725 patients) due to injury. We applied the rural-urban division on the base of number of inhabitants (rural – below, urban – over 25000). We divided injuries into four categories based on severity. Statistical analysis was performed to compare the risk of hospitalization due to different types of injuries among children in different age and sex groups, living in rural and urban areas                  Results:                       Children from urban areas have a higher risk of hospitalization compared to their peers living in rural areas due to two least severe categories of injuries. Children from rural areas had much higher risk of hospitalization due to most severe injuries. Results were consistent for both time intervals.. The average duration of hospitalization was significantly longer among rural populations. However, in both rural and urban areas the mean length of stay has been shortened in comparison with the years 2002-2005. The average age of urban patients has been reduced over the years and remained stable among rural population. In both groups boys comprised the majority of patients with all kinds of injuries.                  Conclusions:                       Analysis of the risk of hospitalization among children from rural and urban areas brings constructive conclusions only after applying the division based on severity of injuries. Children living in rural areas and small towns are at a higher risk of suffering severe injuries that pose a risk of permanent disability, and of longer hospitalization because of them, compared to children living in larger cities."
18,"Fatal traumatic brain injuries in the construction industry, 2003-2010",American journal of industrial medicine,2016 Mar,,"Background:                       Research on fatal work-related traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) is limited. This study describes fatal TBIs in the US construction industry.                  Methods:                       Fatal TBIs were extracted from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries.                  Results:                       From 2003 to 2010, 2,210 fatal TBIs occurred in construction at a rate of 2.6 per 100,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) workers. Workers aged 65 years and older had the highest fatal TBI rates among all workers (7.9 per 100,000 FTE workers). Falls were the most frequent injury event (n = 1,269, 57%). Structural iron and steel workers and roofers had the highest fatal TBI rate per 100,000 FTE workers (13.7 and 11.2, respectively). Fall-related TBIs were the leading cause of death in these occupations.                  Conclusions:                       A large percentage of TBIs in the construction industry were due to falls. Emphasis on safety interventions is needed to reduce these fall-related TBIs, especially among vulnerable workers."

20,Evidence for quality indicators to evaluate adult trauma care: a systematic review,Critical care medicine,2011 Apr,,"Objective:                       Multiple quality indicators are available to evaluate adult trauma care, but their characteristics and outcomes have not been systematically compared. We sought to systematically review the evidence about the reliability, validity, and implementation of quality indicators for evaluating trauma care.                  Data sources:                       Search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and The Cochrane Library up to January 14, 2009; the Gray Literature; select journals by hand; reference lists; and articles recommended by experts in the field.                  Study selection:                       Studies were selected that evaluated the reliability, validity, or the impact of one or more quality indicators on the quality of care delivered to patients ≥ 18 yrs of age with a major traumatic injury.                  Data extraction:                       Reviewers with methodologic and content expertise conducted data extraction independently.                  Data synthesis:                       The literature search identified 6869 citations. Review of abstracts led to the retrieval of 538 full-text articles for assessment; 40 articles were selected for review. Of these, 20 (50%) articles were cohort studies and 13 (33%) articles were case series. Five articles used control groups, including three before and after case series, a case-control study, and a nonrandomized controlled trial. A total of 115 quality indicators in adult trauma care was identified, predominantly measures of hospital processes (62%) and outcomes (17%) of care. We did not identify any posthospital or secondary injury prevention quality indicators. Reliability was described for two quality indicators, content validity for 22 quality indicators, construct validity for eight quality indicators, and criterion validity for 46 quality indicators. A total of 58 quality indicators was implemented and evaluated in three studies. Eight quality indicators had supporting evidence for more than one measurement domain. A single quality indicator, peer review for preventable death, had both reliability and validity evidence.                  Conclusions:                       Although many quality indicators are available to measure the quality of trauma care, reliability evidence, validity evidence, and description of outcomes after implementation are limited."
21,Orofacial trauma awareness among sports teachers in Southern Saudi Arabia,Nigerian journal of clinical practice,2020 Mar,,"Background:                       Dental trauma is a major public oral health problem owing to its high prevalence. The school sports teachers who observe children when they participate in sports have a key role in the prevention and management of traumatic injuries. The present study aims to determine the awareness of sports teachers on the occurrence and prevention of oral-facial trauma in southern Saudi Arabia.                  Methods:                       The present study was a cross-sectional study design among sports teachers in a southern subpopulation of Saudi Arabia. A draft questionnaire with 11 items was constructed under three domains: occurrence pattern, prevention, and management of dental trauma.                  Results:                       A total of 191 sports teachers from various schools participated in the survey. The majority (88%) of the teachers had encountered orofacial trauma among children during sporting activity in schools. The most common orofacial structure involved in injury was the teeth (33.5%) and lips (25.2%). Only 50.8% of subjects knew stock tray as a type of mouthguard and 27.7% of teachers responded that they do not recommend mouthguards for children during sporting activities. Nearly 80.6% teachers were aware of the possibility of reimplanting an avulsed tooth. About 72.8% teachers had poor knowledge of immediate action necessary for successful outcomes of reimplanted teeth.                  Conclusions:                       Orofacial trauma was commonly encountered by sports teachers among children during sporting activities in the school. There was poor awareness regarding types of mouth guards and its significance among the sports school teachers. The knowledge related to the management of emergency oral injuries was inadequate."
22,Frostbites in circumpolar areas,Global health action,2011,,"Circumpolar areas are associated with prolonged cold exposure where wind, precipitation, and darkness further aggravate the environmental conditions and the associated risks. Despite the climate warming, cold climatic conditions will prevail in circumpolar areas and contribute to adverse health effects. Frostbite is a freezing injury where localized damage affects the skin and other tissues. It occurs during occupational or leisure-time activities and is common in the general population among men and women of various ages. Industries of the circumpolar areas where frostbite occurs frequently include transportation, mining, oil, and gas industry, construction, agriculture, and military operations. Cold injuries may also occur during leisure-time activities involving substantial cold exposure, such as mountaineering, skiing, and snowmobiling. Accidental situations (occupational, leisure time) often contribute to adverse cooling and cold injuries. Several environmental (temperature, wind, wetness, cold objects, and altitude) and individual (behavior, health, and physiology) predisposing factors are connected with frostbite injuries. Vulnerable populations include those having a chronic disease (cardiovascular, diabetes, and depression), children and the elderly, or homeless people. Frostbite results in sequelae causing different types of discomfort and functional limitations that may persist for years. A frostbite injury is preventable, and hence, unacceptable from a public health perspective. Appropriate cold risk management includes awareness of the adverse effects of cold, individual adjustment of cold exposure and clothing, or in occupational context different organizational and technical measures. In addition, vulnerable population groups need customized information and care for proper prevention of frostbites."
23,In Search of Concrete Outcomes-A Systematic Review on the Effectiveness of Educational Interventions on Reducing Acute Occupational Injuries,International journal of environmental research and public health,2020 Sep 20,,"Education is a common strategy used to prevent occupational injuries. However, its effectiveness is often measured using surrogate measures instead of true injury outcomes. To evaluate the effectiveness of workplace educational interventions, we selectively analyzed studies that reported injury outcomes (PROSPERO ID: CRD42019140631). We searched databases for peer-reviewed journal articles and sources of grey literature such as abstracts, registered trials, and theses published between 2000 and 2019. Studies on educational interventions that reported fatal or non-fatal occupational injury outcomes were selected. Two reviewers independently and in duplicate screened the studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Heterogeneity in the data precluded meta-analysis, and the results were reviewed narratively. In total, 35 studies were included. Of which, 17 found a significant reduction in injuries, most of which featured a multifaceted approach or non-didactic education. The remaining studies either described equivocal results or did not report statistical significance. Overall, interventions in the manufacturing industry were more effective than those in the construction sector. Risk of bias among included studies was moderate to high. In conclusion, educational interventions could be an effective part of multifaceted injury prevention programs. However, over-reliance on didactic education alone is not advised."
24,"Non-fatal construction industry fall-related injuries treated in US emergency departments, 1998-2005",American journal of industrial medicine,2011 Feb,,"Background:                       There is a growing recognition that common occupational injury surveillance systems in the US fail to reflect true injury risk; this failure limits efforts to accurately monitor efforts to prevent work-related injuries on a national level.                  Methods:                       Data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System occupational supplement (NEISS-Work) were used to describe fall-related injuries treated in US emergency departments among workers in the construction industry (1998-2005). These data do not require workers' compensation as the payer in order to be classified as work-related.                  Results:                       Based on NEISS-Work estimates, a total of 555,700 (95% confidence interval (CI): 390,700-720,800) non-fatal work-related injuries among workers in the construction industry were the result of a fall, resulting in an annual rate of 70 (95% CI: 49-91) per 10,000 full-time equivalents. Younger workers had higher rates of falls, whereas older workers were more likely to suffer serious injuries. The majority of the injuries (70%) were precipitated by falls to a lower level from roofs, ladders, and scaffolding.                  Conclusions:                       The patterns of fall-related injuries identified in these data are consistent with other reports. In contrast to the declining rates of falls requiring days away from work reported through the Bureau of Labor Statistics Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses, construction industry fall-related injury rates estimated through NEISS-Work remained unchanged from 1998 to 2005 providing another perspective on this serious cause of morbidity in the construction industry."
25,Children's perceptions of injuries: a qualitative study in Sweden,Pediatric nursing,2013 Sep-Oct,,"To understand one of the major public health problems for children, it is important to consider the children's perspective. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore, describe, and categorize children's perceptions of injury severity and children's explanations of the injuries they experience. A total of 29 students from six randomly selected schools were interviewed in age groups of 9, 13, and 17 years. Manifest content analysis according to Graneheim and Lundman (2004) was used to categorize children's own statements. Need of medical attention, long-term consequences, and familiarity with the injury risk situation were identified as important determinants of children's perception of injury severity. Three categories emerged from children's explanations of their injuries: ""Because of Me"" (beliefs, lack of concentration, health conditions, and lack of awareness of risk), ""Because of the Situation"" (rain, ice, wind, animals, inanimate objects, constructions, and the children's games), and ""Just Inexplicable"" to the children. Findings suggest that children have a wide perception of injury severity and that children's beliefs of injury causation, as well as children's familiarity with injury risk situations, need to be considered in future studies focusing on the development of childhood injury prevention strategies. Additionally, results suggest that sometimes children cannot or do not want to explain their injuries."
26,New functional pavements for pedestrians and cyclists,Accident; analysis and prevention,2017 Aug,,"When many fields of pedestrian and cyclist safety have been extensively studied, the surfacing has long been left unquestioned, despite being developed for another mode of transport and being one of the main causes for falls and fall injuries. In this project new surfacing materials for pedestrian and cyclist safety have been produced. Focusing on augmenting previously largely disregarded parameters as impact absorption, comfort and visibility at the same time as avoiding deteriorating of crucial parameters as friction and wear resistance. Rubber content, binder type, and pigment addition have been varied and evaluated. The results demonstrate that by increasing rubber content of the mixtures the head injury criterion (HIC) value and injury risk can be decreased while maintaining frictional properties according to existing criteria. Assembly of test-lanes demonstrate that some developed materials experience lower flow and component separation than standard materials due to rubber addition, calling for further optimisation of construction procedure linked to content development. Initial trials on the test-lanes indicate that a polyurethane (PU) based material has high cycling comfort, visibility and can be modified with phosphorescence properties. For standard asphalt, impact absorption might be inflicted by modification of bitumen alone but is mostly augmented by rubber addition. The results also indicate that rubber content can decrease ice formation on the materials."
27,A fresh look at the costs of non-fatal consumer product injuries,Injury prevention : journal of the International Society for Child and Adolescent Injury Prevention,2015 Feb,,"Background:                       Products under the purview of the Consumer Product Safety Commission are involved in a large share of injuries and injury costs in the USA.                  Methods:                       This study analyses incidence data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) and cost data based on the Injury Cost Model, integrated with the NEISS. We examined the magnitude of non-fatal consumer product related injury, the distribution of products involved in these injuries and the cost of these injuries. We compared these findings with an earlier identical study from 2000.                  Results:                       In 2008-2010, 43.8% of the annual 30.4 million non-fatal injuries treated in hospital emergency departments involved consumer products. Of these consumer product related injuries, in 2009-2010, just three product groups accounted for 77% of the $909 billion annual cost: sports and recreation; home structures and construction materials; and home furnishings and fixtures. Sports and recreation was a leading cause of injury costs among 5-24-year-olds, particularly football, basketball, bicycling, baseball/softball and soccer. Since 1996, football surpassed basketball in becoming the number one cause of injury costs for children aged 10-19 years and the fifth ranked cause of product related injury costs overall. Among those over age 30 years, stairs and floors were a leading cause of consumer product related injury costs, in particular among those over age 70 years where they were responsible for over one-fifth of costs.                  Conclusions:                       The findings of this study highlight priority areas for intervention and generate questions for future research."
28,Bridge Plating Length-Unstable Pediatric Femoral Shaft Fractures,Journal of pediatric orthopedics,2016 Jun,,"The treatment of pediatric diaphyseal femur fractures, particularly length-unstable fractures, continues to be an area of controversy in patients from age 6 to skeletal maturity. Submuscular bridge plating is an alternative that allows for stable internal fixation while minimizing soft tissue disruption. We describe a surgical technique that has simplified both implantation and removal. This technique provides a stable construct in comminuted and unstable fracture patterns allowing for early mobilization with minimal complications."
29,Artificial Intelligence Image-Assisted Knee Ligament Trauma Repair Efficacy Analysis and Postoperative Femoral Nerve Block Analgesia Effect Research,World neurosurgery,2021 May,,"Objective:                       To analyze artificial intelligence image-assisted knee ligament injury repair and femoral nerve block analgesia after surgery.                  Methods:                       Data-driven and artificial intelligence methods were adopted to systematically study magnetic resonance imaging image reconstruction, processing, and analysis. First, knee ligament reconstruction and femoral arteriography images were studied. Using the prior knowledge that the full width at half maximum of the contrast image does not change with the resolution, a constrained data exploration algorithm was proposed combined with the iterative algorithm. The algorithm could reconstruct high-resolution images using the collected low-frequency data of k-space. The experimental data and results were simulated with the enhanced knee ligaments and femoral nerve angiography images. Combining the spatial continuity of knee ligaments and femoral nerve, a multilayer input segmentation network was designed. The multisupervised network was adopted for output and had good segmentation results for the knee ligaments and femoral nerve. On this basis, a multiparametric image input speaker net was proposed to detect knee ligament injuries.                  Results:                       The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the constructed model under the test set was 0.824, and the sensitivity and specificity were 0.800 and 0.836, respectively. The image was better than compressed sensing to reconstruct the image, which was more accurate for knee ligament and femoral nerve stenosis. The network also had higher sensitivity for knee joint trauma detection, which could aid clinicians. The postoperative femoral nerve block had a good detection effect, which could provide important information for clinical analgesia.                  Conclusions:                       The artificial intelligence image-assisted diagnosis system for analysis and processing of multiparametric magnetic resonance images is useful for clinical decision making, reducing physicians' labor intensity, improving efficiency, and lowering the rate of misdiagnosis."
30,Biomechanics of subdural hemorrhage in American football: review of the literature in response to rise in incidence,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,2014 Feb,,"The number of catastrophic head injuries recorded during the 2011 football season was the highest since data collection began in 1984--the vast majority of these cases were secondary to subdural hemorrhage (SDH). The incidence of catastrophic head injury continues to rise: the average yearly incidence from 2008 to 2012 was 238% that of the average yearly incidence from 1998 to 2002. Greater than 95% of the football players who suffered catastrophic head injury during this period were age 18 or younger. Currently, the helmet industry utilizes a standard based on data obtained at Wayne State University approximately 50 years ago that seeks to limit severity index--a surrogate marker of translational acceleration. In this manuscript, we utilize a focused review of the literature to better characterize the biomechanical factors associated with SDH following collisions in American football and discuss these data in the context of current helmet standard. Review of the literature indicates the rotational acceleration (RA) threshold above which the risk of SDH becomes appreciable is approximately 5,000 rad/s(2). This value is not infrequently surmounted in typical high school football games. In contrast, translational accelerations (TAs) experienced during even elite-level impacts in football are not of sufficient magnitude to result in SDH. This information raises important questions about the current helmet standard--in which the sole objective is limitation of TA. Further studies will be necessary to better define whether helmet constructs and quality assurance standards designed to limit RA will also help to decrease the risk of catastrophic head injury in American football."
31,"[Pseudarthrosis and construct failure after lumbar pedicle subtraction osteotomy : Influence of biomechanics, surgical technique, biology and avoidance strategies]",Der Orthopade,2018 Apr,,"There are numerous factors that can lead to construct failure and pseudarthrosis after corrective pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO) in the lumbar spine. Frequently, several factors are of relevance in these problematic cases. This article attempts to explain the surgical, biomechanical and biological aspects that should be understood in order to minimize the risk of pseudarthrosis and construct failure. It addresses technical varieties of the PSO procedure as well as the surgical technique, the choice of rod material and the design of multirod constructs. Biological reasons for pseudarthrosis and preventive strategies are discussed, as well as the possible contribution of low-grade infections to pseudarthrosis. The option of substituting a multilevel ALIF procedure for a PSO is another topic, as is the question of surgical indication and strategy."
32,Inhibition of Nf-ҝb prevents trauma-induced heterotopic ossification in rat model,Connective tissue research,2019 May,,"Purpose:                       To investigate the pathogenesis and find a better prophylactic method of acquired heterotopic ossification (HO).                  Materials and methods:                       In the first part, we designed the brain-traumatic/burn/tenotomy rat model and testified its efficacy as HO model. 44 rats were randomly divided into experimental group and control group. After operation, the bilateral tendons of 2 rats were collected at the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th weeks to determine the expression levels of p65. Additionally, the remaining rats were exposed to X-Ray examination at the 10th week. In the second part, 124 rats were randomly divided into four groups based on the administration dosage of Ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC). Then, three rats of each group were euthanized every week in the first seven weeks to collect tendon to detect the expression levels of p65 by qRT-PCR and Western Blot. The remaining rats were exposed to X-Ray examination at the 10th week to assess the size of HO before being euthanized for HE staining.                  Results:                       The success rate of Brain-traumatic/Burn/Tenotomy model was 100%. Pharmacologic inhibition of Nf-ҝb signaling pathway by PDTC could significantly reduce the expression levels of p53 and the size of HO, and the reduction was most significant in the 0.6mg dosage group.                  Conclusions:                       Brain-traumatic/Burn/Tenotomy model was highly reliable HO model. Inhibition of Nf-ҝb signaling pathway by PDTC could significantly reduce HO formation, and the most effective concentration was 6 mg/ml for local injection."

The Kentucky Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation program analyzed 2001-2014 worker fatality data. The Kentucky FBW fatality rate was double the US FBW and NBW rates, and 50% higher than the Kentucky NBW fatality rate. FBW average age at death was 38 years; NBW age was 47 years. FBW deaths occurred in construction (26%) and services (22%) industries, and transportation [28% (54% due to semi truck crashes)] and construction [26%(48% due to roofing, scaffolding, and ladder-related falls)] occupations; in contrast, NBW deaths occurred in services (22%), and transportation (18%) industries, and transportation (25%) and management (20%) occupations, and were due to exposures to inanimate mechanical forces (38%), and transport accidents (30%). Enhanced FBW cultural competent interventions and policies are needed to prevent FBW occupational injuries, and improve FBW workplace safety and health."
34,Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration (SIRVA): An Occupational Case Report,Workplace health & safety,2019 Oct,,"Transient shoulder pain is a common complaint following intramuscular vaccine administration into the deltoid. More severe vaccination-associated shoulder complications comprising of weakness and decreased range of motion are categorized under the construct ""shoulder injury related to vaccine administration"" (SIRVA) that subsumes both subjective and objective findings consistent with injury. We describe the presentation and management of a case of SIRVA in a health care worker following seasonal influenza vaccine administration as part of a hospital-based employee health program and review the relevant biomedical literature. We present a case from a single medical center. All data were collected by professionals in occupational health by interviewing, performing physical examinations, and reviewing medical records associated with the injured worker. Severe pain and limited range of shoulder motion developed following an influenza vaccination that was administered using a poorly positioned, larger than recommended needle. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated moderate glenohumeral joint effusion and synovitis, with fluid accumulating in the subscapularis recess within 1 week of injury. At 8 months after initial injury, MRI showed persistent mild tenosynovitis of the long head of the biceps tendon, interval accumulation of a large glenohumeral joint effusion, and infraspinatus tendinitis with subjacent reactive bone marrow edema. The affected worker experienced work restrictions but had no complete lost workdays to date due to the injury. Occupationally related SIRVA is a preventable adverse event that should be considered in workplace vaccine administration programs, and appropriate education and training provided to vaccine administrators to address this."
35,Facilitators and Barriers to the Implementation of iSPRINT: A Sport Injury Prevention Program in Junior High Schools,Clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the Canadian Academy of Sport Medicine,2020 May,,"Objectives:                       Sport injury is the leading cause of hospitalization in Canadian youth and represents a high burden to the health care system. This study aims to describe the facilitators and barriers to implementation of a sport injury prevention program in junior high school physical education (known as iSPRINT), previously shown to reduce the risk of sport-related injury in youth (age, 11-15 years).                  Methods:                       Focus group data were mapped onto constructs from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Four schools that implemented iSPRINT participated in this study. Forty-seven key stakeholders (teachers, students, principals) participated in 9 semistructured focus groups and 4 interviews. The CFIR was used to guide the focus group discussions, data coding, and analysis using a qualitative content analysis approach.                  Results:                       Of the 22 applicable CFIR constructs, 16 were identified in the transcripts. The most significant facilitators to successful implementation efforts included evidence strength and quality, adaptability, implementation climate, culture, and having a high level of compatibility facilitated successful implementation efforts. Barriers to implementation included intervention complexity, planning, and readiness for implementation. Constructs that acted as both a facilitator and a barrier, depending on the context, were self-efficacy, execution, and individual identification with the organization.                  Conclusions:                       Participants in this study reported positive attitudes about implementing iSPRINT, citing evidence strength, adaptability, and constructs related to the organizational setting that contributed to successful implementation. Potential improvements include modifying certain program components, decreasing the number of components, and reducing the equipment required."
36,US Department of Defense Warfighter Brain Health Initiative: Maximizing performance on and off the battlefield,Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners,2020 Nov,,"The US Department of Defense (DoD) recognizes the importance of warfighter brain health with the establishment of the Warfighter Brain Health Initiative and Strategy. For a warfighter, also known as a service member, to perform at their highest level, cognitive and physical capabilities must be optimized. This initiative addresses brain health, brain exposures, to include blast overpressure exposures from weapons and munitions, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and long-term or late effects of TBI. The DoD's pursuit of maximal strength hinges on the speed of decisions (neurocognitive) and detection of brain injury when it occurs. The strategy creates a framework for deliberate, prioritized, and rapid development of end-to-end solutions for warfighter brain health. Through this strategy, DoD is addressing the needs of our service members, their families, line leaders/commanders, and their communities at large. The implications of this initiative and strategy are noteworthy for practitioners because the DoD Warfighter Brain Health construct lends itself to nurse practitioner engagement in clinical practice, patient education, policy development, and emerging research."
37,Standards of external fixation in prolonged applications to allow safe conversion to definitive extremity surgery: the Aachen algorithm for acute ex fix conversion,Injury,2015 Sep,,"External fixation has become an important tool in orthopedic surgery. Technology has improved the design and material as well as the construct of the fixator. As most patients are converted from external fixation to definite stabilization during later clinical course, prevention of complications such as infection is of high importance. Based on the current literature, principles of temporary external fixation were summarized. We focused on minimizing the risk of infection and introduce a standardized algorithm how to proceed when converting from external to internal fixation, which also was examined for effectiveness."
38,Evaluation of nature and extent of injuries during Dahihandi festival,Journal of postgraduate medicine,2012 Oct-Dec,,"Background:                       Injuries related to the Hindu festival of Dahihandi where a human pyramid is formed and a pot of money kept at a height is broken, celebrated in the state of Maharashtra, have seen a significant rise in the past few years. The human pyramid formed is multi-layered and carries with it a high risk of injury including mortality.                  Aims:                       To evaluate the nature, extent and influencing factors of injuries related to Dahihandi festival.                  Settings and design:                       We present a retrospective analysis of patients who presented in a tertiary care center with injuries during the Dahihandi festival in the year 2010.                  Materials and methods:                       124 patients' records were evaluated for timing of injury, height of the Dahihandi pyramid, position of the patient in the multi-layered pyramid, mode of pyramid collapse and mechanism of an injury. A binary regression logistic analysis for risk factors was done at 5% significance level.                  Statistical analysis:                       Univariate and multi-variate binary logistic regression of the risk factors for occurrence of a major or minor injury was done using Minitab™ version 16.0 at 5% significance.                  Results:                       Out of 139 patients presented to the center, 15 were not involved directly in the formation of pyramid, rest 124 were included in the analysis. A majority of the patients were above 15 years of age [110 (83.6%)]. 46 (37.1%) patients suffered major injuries. There were 39 fractures, 3 cases of chest wall trauma with 10 cases of head injuries and 1 death. More than half of the patients [78 (56.1%)] were injured after 1800 hours. 73 (58.9%) injured participants were part of the pyramid constructed to reach the Dahihandi placed at 30 feet or more above the ground. 72 (51.8%) participants were part of the middle layers of the pyramid. Fall of a participant from upstream layers on the body was the main mechanism of injury, and majority [101 (81.5%)] of the patients suffered injury during descent phase of the pyramid.                  Conclusions:                       There is a considerable risk of serious, life-threatening injuries inherent to human pyramid formation and descent in the Dahihandi festival. Safety guidelines are urgently needed to minimize risk and prevent loss of human life."
39,A 10-year review of sports-related spinal injuries,Irish journal of medical science,2011 Dec,,"Introduction:                       The incidence of traumatic spinal cord injury varies in different countries from 2.5 to 57.8 per million per annum, with sport accounting for 8-12.7% of these injuries. Spinal injuries associated with recreational sport often result in long-term permanent disability in otherwise active individuals.                  Materials and methods:                       The aetiology, pattern and mechanism of the 196 sports-related spinal injuries treated in the National Spinal Injuries unit in Ireland from 1993 to 2003 is reviewed in this article.                  Results:                       Sports-related spinal injuries accounted for 11% of all spinal injury admissions. There were 145 (74%) males and 51 (26%) females, with an average age of 30.2 years (range 14-72 years). The most common sport responsible for a spinal injury was equestrian events (41.8%), rugby (16.3%), diving (15.3%), Gaelic football and hurling (9.6%), cycling (4.2%), and miscellaneous (12.7%). Injury distribution was cervical spine (118 patients, 60%), thoracic (41 patients, 21%), lumbar spine (37 patients, 19%). In 18 patients (9.25%) more than one region was affected. In 78 patients (40%) more than one vertebral level was affected. On admission 71 patients (36%) had a neurological deficit with 46 patients (65%) incomplete and 25 (35%) complete, of which 6 patients (23%) were paraplegic and 19 (77%) were tetraplegic.                  Conclusion:                       Sport is an important cause of spinal injury among young people in Ireland. This study contributes to our understanding of these injuries aetiology, pattern and mechanism of injury and allows constructive recommendations for injury prevention and management."
40,Steel rod impalement injuries involving the spine: A case report and literature review,Ulusal travma ve acil cerrahi dergisi = Turkish journal of trauma & emergency surgery : TJTES,2019 Jul,,"Steel rod impalements, mostly experienced by construction workers due to falls from heights, are known entities, but only some individuals unfortunately suffer spinal cord injury. The management of the spine involved injuries is challenging due to the lack of guidelines, various clinical presentations resulting from different trajectories, and high risk of infection. We report a case of steel rod impalement involving the spinal canal and review the literature to enhance the management strategies and to identify the risk factors for possible complications, particularly infection. A 37-year-old male construction worker presented to our emergency department due to falling onto a concrete reinforcing steel rod that penetrated through his perineum to the L4 vertebra. Examination revealed paralysis and sensory loss of the left foot. The rod was removed in the operating room (closed removal) under general anesthesia, followed by laparotomy. Rectal laceration was primarily repaired, and colostomy was performed. In a separate session, laminectomy was performed. At 3 months post-discharge, the patient was ambulatory with armrest based on the same motor examination performed on presentation This case is a good example of careful preoperative planning, multidisciplinary involvement, and appropriately sequenced interventions resulting in an acceptable outcome for an injury with high morbidity and mortality and demonstrates the feasibility and potential benefits of closed removal of the rod in an operating room just before laparotomy. The presence of an intestinal perforation increases the infection risk, but infections can still be prevented in this setting. Shorter time intervals between the incidence and surgery may reduce the infection rate."
41,"Current trends in pedicle screw stimulation techniques: lumbosacral, thoracic, and cervical levels",The Neurodiagnostic journal,2012 Jun,,"Unequivocally, pedicle screw instrumentation has evolved as a primary construct for the treatment of both common and complex spinal disorders. However an inevitable and potentially major complication associated with this type of surgery is misplacement of a pedicle screw(s) which may result in neural and vascular complications, as well as impair the biomechanical stability of the spinal instrumentation resulting in loss of fixation. In light of these potential surgical complications, critical reviews of outcome data for treatment of chronic, low-back pain using pedicle screw instrumentation concluded that ""pedicle screw fixation improves radiographically demonstrated fusion rates;"" however the expense and complication rates for such constructs are considerable in light of the clinical benefit (Resnick et al. 2005a). Currently, neuromonitoring using free-run and evoked (triggered) electromyography (EMG) is widely used and advocated for safer and more accurate placement of pedicle screws during open instrumentation procedures, and more recently, guiding percutaneous placement (minimally invasive) where the pedicle cannot be easily inspected visually. The latter technique, evoked or triggered EMG when applied to pedicle screw instrumentation surgeries, has been referred to as the pedicle screw stimulation technique. As concluded in the Position Statement by the American Society of Neurophysiological Monitoring (ASNM), multimodality neuromonitoring using free-run EMG and the pedicle screw stimulation technique was considered a practice option and not yet a standard of care (Leppanen 2005). Subsequently, the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons (AANS/CNS) Joint Section on Disorders of the Spine and Peripheral Nerves published their ""Guidelines for the Performance of Fusion Procedures for Degenerative Disease of the Lumbar Spine"" (Heary 2005, Resnick et al. 2005a, Resnick et al. 2005b). It was concluded that the ""primary justification"" of intraoperative neuromonitoring""... is the perception that the safety and efficacy of pedicle screw fixation are enhanced..."" (Resnick et al. 2005b). However in summarizing a massive (over 1000 papers taken from the National Library of Medicine), contemporary, literature review spanning nearly a decade (1996 to 2003), this invited panel (Resnick et al. 2005b) recognized that the evidence-based documents contributing to the parts related to pedicle screw fixation and neuromonitoring were ""... full of potential sources of error ..."" and lacked appropriate, randomized, prospective studies for formulating rigid standards and guidelines. Nevertheless, current trends support the routine use and clinical utility of these neuromonitoring techniques. In particular free-run and triggered EMG have been well recognized in numerous publications for improving both the accuracy and safety of pedicle screw implantation. Currently, treatment with pedicle screw instrumentation routinely involves all levels of the spine - lumbosacral, thoracic, and cervical. Significant historical events, various neuromonitoring modalities, intraoperative alarm criteria, clinical efficacy, current trends, and caveats related to pedicle screw stimulation along the entire vertebral column will be reviewed."
42,What is the role of TPE in management of patients at risk or with pressure ulcer as of 2012? Developing French guidelines for clinical practice,Annals of physical and rehabilitation medicine,2012 Oct,,"Introduction:                       Pressure ulcer (PU) is a common complication in chronic affection, especially neurological disorders and diseases commonly diagnosed in the elderly. For a long period of time, the prevention of skin lesions was taught only in an empirical manner. The development of therapeutic patient education (TPE) sheds a new light on care management for patients with chronic pathologies.                  Objectives:                       Determine the place of TPE in persons at risk of and/or already suffering from pressure ulcer (PU) as of 2012.                  Methods:                       The methodology used is the one promoted by SOFMER, including: a systematic review of the literature with a query of the PASCAL Biomed, PubMed and Cochrane Library databases for data from 2000 through 2010; a compendium of prevailing professional practices and advice from a committee of experts.                  Results:                       The review of the literature found six studies including four controlled trials in patients with chronic neurological impairments (most of them with spinal cord injury). No studies were found regarding the elderly. The level of evidence for efficacy in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) is moderate. The clinical practice study focuses on programs currently underway, dedicated to SCI patients or elderly populations.                  Discussion:                       The approach proposed through TPE has its role in a strategy aimed at preventing PU in persons at chronic risk of developing PU. The educational objectives and techniques used must be adapted to the clinical and psychological context and are debated in this review. The co-construction of programs, recommended in the official texts on therapeutic education in France, should help to tailor these programs to the patients' needs.                  Conclusion:                       TPE is relevant in care management or prevention of PU in persons at chronic risk, patients with spinal cord injury (Grade B) or elderly subjects (Grade C)."
43,Inpatient Data of Occupational Burn Injuries Treated at a Tertiary Burn Center,Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association,2020 Feb 19,,"Occupational burns are among the important causes of work-related injuries. We aimed to investigate the epidemiology and reasons of occupational burns and thereby to emphasize preventive measures. Between January 2017 and December 2018, the data of major occupational burn injury patients admitted to our burn center were evaluated in this cross-sectional retrospective study. During the study period 342 patients older than 16 years were admitted to the burn center. Among them 80 patients with occupational burns (23.4%) were identified. The mean age of the patients was 34.73 ± 12.3 years. Seventy-eight patients (97.5%) were male. Electrical burns and flame burns were the two leading type of occupational burns. The most common occupation of our patients was construction work. Dangerous behavior, carelessness, lack of protective equipment, and failure to follow instructions were causes of injury. Only 14 patients (17.5%) experienced unavoidable accident. Thirty-seven patients (46.3%) worked on temporary basis. Occupational experience was under 5 years in majority of the cases (62.5%). For the occupational burns the percentage of burned TBSA was 17.08 ± 14.5 (1-60) and the length of hospital stay was 23.94 ± 21.9 days (2-106). There were no significant differences between occupational and nonoccupational burn injuries considering TBSA, total length of hospital stay, and complications (P > .05). Occupational burn injuries are common in less experienced and younger workers. Therefore, recognition of the problem and maintaining awareness is important. In order to prevent occupational accidents and burns, occupational health and safety rules must be obeyed."
44,The business cycle and the incidence of workplace injuries: evidence from the U.S.A,Journal of safety research,2011 Feb,,"Introduction:                       The current study explored the association between the business cycle and the incidence of workplace injuries to identify cyclically sensitive industries and the relative contribution of physical capital and labor utilization within industries.                  Method:                       Bureau of Labor Statistics nonfatal injury rates from 1976 through 2007 were examined across five industry sectors with respect to several macroeconomic indicators. Within industries, injury associations with utilization of labor and physical capital over time were tested using time series regression methods.                  Results:                       Pro-cyclical associations between business cycle indicators and injury incidence were observed in mining, construction, and manufacturing but not in agriculture or trade. Physical capital utilization was the highest potential contributor to injuries in mining while labor utilization was the highest potential contributor in construction. In manufacturing each effect had a similar association with injuries.                  Conclusion:                       The incidence of workplace injury is associated with the business cycle. However, the degree of association and the mechanisms through with the business cycle affects the incidence of workplace injuries was not the same across industries.                  Impact on industry:                       The results suggest that firms in the construction, manufacturing, and mining industries should take additional precautionary safety measures during cyclical upturns. Potential differences among industries in the mechanisms through which the business cycle affects injury incidence suggest different protective strategies for those industries. For example, in construction, additional efforts might be undertaken to ensure workers are adequately trained and not excessively fatigued, while safety procedures continue to be followed even during boom times."
45,The benefits of an additional worker are task-dependent: assessing low-back injury risks during prefabricated (panelized) wall construction,Applied ergonomics,2012 Sep,,"Team manual material handling is a common practice in residential construction where prefabricated building components (e.g., wall panels) are increasingly used. As part of a larger effort to enable proactive control of ergonomic exposures among workers handling panels, this study explored the effects of additional workers on injury risks during team-based panel erection tasks, specifically by quantifying how injury risks are affected by increasing the number of workers (by one, above the nominal or most common number). Twenty-four participants completed panel erection tasks with and without an additional worker under different panel mass and size conditions. Four risk assessment methods were employed that emphasized the low back. Though including an additional worker generally reduced injury risk across several panel masses and sizes, the magnitude of these benefits varied depending on the specific task and exhibited somewhat high variability within a given task. These results suggest that a simple, generalizable recommendation regarding team-based panel erection tasks is not warranted. Rather, a more systems-level approach accounting for both injury risk and productivity (a strength of panelized wall systems) should be undertaken."
46,Analysis of factors affecting injury severity for riders or occupants of all-terrain vehicles and golf carts involved in police-reported crashes,Accident; analysis and prevention,2019 Dec,,"In recent years, the popularity of all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) in the United States (US) has increased, and the number of ATV driver and passenger deaths have also increased substantially in the last few decades. Riders or occupants of ATVs as well as golf carts are particularly vulnerable to injury, not only due to the lack of protection and safety equipment offered by their vehicles, but also the propensity for ejection in the event of a crash. Given the vulnerability of these road users, it's critical to understand factors which may affect injury severity to plan effective countermeasures aimed at reducing these injuries and fatalities. To better understand factors affecting the injury severity of ATV and golf cart riders or occupants involved in police-reported crashes, this study presents an analysis using six years of crash data from the US state of Arizona. Over the analysis period, there were 1769 drivers/passengers of these vehicle types involved in police-reported crashes. Of these occupants/riders, 67.7% were injured or killed as a result of the crash; a proportion significantly higher than police-reported crashes involving most other vehicle types, exhibiting the need to examine factors leading to these injuries and fatalities. In order to analyse factors affecting the injury severity of ATV and golf cart occupants/riders, a random parameters (RP) ordered logit statistical model was developed, which was most appropriate given the ordered nature of injury-severity data. Several person- vehicle- roadway- and environmental-related variables were found to significantly affect the injury severity of riders or occupants of ATVs and golf carts. Given the vulnerability of these road users, it's important for transportation agencies to explore effective countermeasures aimed at reducing the severity of crashes involving these vehicle types. The results of this study provide important insights which can assist in developing effective engineering-, enforcement-, education, or policy-related countermeasures."
47,Characterization of load reduction while lifting drywall using an unpowered drywall lifting device,"Work (Reading, Mass.)",2018,,"Background:                       Drywall installation has an injury rate four times that of the construction industry average. Workers are exposed to hazards related to slips, falls, and falling objects, in addition to the large and awkward loads they must carry. Drywall sheets can weigh more than 100 lb. and contribute to disabling musculoskeletal injuries of the shoulders and back.                  Objective:                       In this study, an unpowered lift assist device was developed to manage the load of a drywall sheet during the installation process.                  Methods:                       In order to measure the effect of the lift assist device, a laboratory study with 10 healthy male participants performing two lifts, lifting from ground to erect and lifting from erect to ceiling, with and without the help of the device, was performed. These lifts were chosen to simulate a drywall installer's frequent lifting motions. Participants were fitted with electromyography (EMG) on the erector spinae, latissimus dorsi, rectus abdominus, and external oblique muscles to measure activation. Mean, peak, and effort data for the lifting exercises were extracted and compared to the unassisted lift.                  Results:                       The lift assist device resulted in a reduction in mean EMG signal of 69% average over both lifts and muscle groups. Peak EMG and effort (i.e., area under the curve) were reduced by 78% and 75%, respectively.                  Conclusions:                       These data demonstrate the effectiveness of the device in reducing compressive back loads during drywall installation, which warrants future development."
48,Anatomy of Mine Rescue Teams' Casualty Incidents: A Basis for Medical Emergency Preparedness and Injury Prevention,Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,2019 Aug,,"Objective:                       Mine rescue teams bear a high risk of injury. To improve medical emergency preparedness and injury prevention, this work analyzed the causes and severity of mine rescue teams' casualty incidents, the primary injuries, and the link between the causes and the occurrences of the casualty incidents.                  Methods:                       A total of 81 cases from 1953 to 2013 were used to analyze the casualty incidents of mine rescue teams based on the frequency of accidents. A panel with 4 rescue experts was set up to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.                  Results:                       The 81 casualty incidents occurred in 7 types of rescue work and were due to 6 causes. Organizational and personal factors were the leading cause, followed by rescue skill and equipment factors. Problems with decision-making and command have gradually become the primary inducement of casualty incidents in recent years, with an average death toll reaching up to 6 to 7 people. The main injuries causing death to team members were blast injury, burns, poisoning, suffocation, blunt trauma, and overwork injury. Some of the injured died because of medical emergency response failure.                  Conclusion:                       The construction of emergency medical teams and the preparedness of disaster medicine need to be improved to reduce the mortality of the injured team members. Actions according to the causes of casualty incidents should be adopted for injury prevention. (Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness. 2019;13:695-699)."
49,A study of trade-specific occupational ergonomics considerations in the U.S. construction industry,"Work (Reading, Mass.)",2012,,"Objective:                       The aim of this survey study was to identify trade-specific ergonomic issues, and discuss practical solutions to reduce work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) and injuries in the construction industry.                  Method:                       Thirty-two construction firms in the Midwestern United States completed the final survey questionnaire. Twelve different construction skilled trades participated included: general contractor, road, heavy and highway, concrete, electrical, carpentry, landscaping, plumbing, roofing, steel erection, street lighting/traffic signal, and utility construction. Total workforce of the participating companies numbered 11,118 employees.                  Result:                       More than 90% of the participants in the survey had a written safety program; however, the majority of the firms did not have a trade-specific ergonomic intervention. The survey revealed that construction constructors perceived safety (worker well-being) as a high priority in their company. This study suggested that construction skilled-trade jobs the construction worker to employ trade-specific hand tools and working body positions that may contribute to different types of WMSD risks, body parts injured, and injury sources. Possible practical construction trade-specific ergonomic solutions might be considered includinge: selection of ergonomic hand tools, reduction of weight of construction materials, and promotion of wellness exercises.                  Conclusion:                       This paper may imply that need for more trade-specific ergonomics program elements to help alleviate the work-related musculoskeletal problems in the construction field."
50,Targeted rehabilitation after extracellular matrix scaffold transplantation for the treatment of volumetric muscle loss,American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation,2014 Nov,,"Rehabilitation therapy is an important aspect of recovery after volumetric muscle loss. However, the traditional rehabilitation approach involves a period of rest and passive loading followed by gradual active loading. Extracellular matrix is a naturally occurring material consisting of structural proteins that provide mechanical strength, structural support, and functional molecules with diverse bioactive properties. There is evidence to suggest that the addition of aggressive regenerative rehabilitation protocols immediately after surgical implantation of an extracellular matrix scaffold to an area of volumetric muscle loss has significant benefits for extracellular matrix remodeling. Rehabilitation exercises likely provide the needed mechanical signals to encourage cell migration and site-specific differentiation in the temporal framework required for constructive remodeling. Herein, the authors review the literature and present an example of an aggressive rehabilitation program implemented immediately after extracellular matrix transplantation into a severely injured quadriceps muscle."
51,California's nurse-to-patient ratio law and occupational injury,International archives of occupational and environmental health,2015 May,,"Objective:                       To determine whether state-mandated minimum nurse-to-patient staffing ratios in California hospitals had an effect on reported occupational injury and illness rates.                  Methods:                       The difference-in-differences method was applied: The change in injury rates among hospital nurses after implementation of the law in California was compared to the change in 49 other states and the District of Columbia combined. Data were drawn from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and the California Employment Development Department, including numerator estimates of injury and illness cases and denominator estimates of the number of registered nurses (RNs) and licensed practical nurses (LPNs) employed in hospitals. Confidence intervals (CIs) for rates were constructed based on assumptions that favored the null hypothesis.                  Results:                       The most probable difference-in-differences estimate indicated that the California law was associated with 55.57 fewer occupational injuries and illnesses per 10,000 RNs per year, a value 31.6 % lower than the expected rate without the law. The most probable reduction for LPNs was 38.2 %. Analyses of CIs suggested that these reductions were unlikely to be due to chance [corrected].                  Conclusions:                       Despite significant data restrictions and corresponding methodological limitations, the evidence suggests that the law was effective in reducing occupational injury and illness rates for both RNs and LPNs. Whether these 31.6 and 38.2 % reductions are maintained over time remains to be seen [corrected]."
52,Risk management project for work with precast concrete shells,"Work (Reading, Mass.)",2012,,"This paper describes a project with the aim of reducing the risk of injury when using precast concrete shells in the Swedish construction industry by identifying injury risks, developing and implementing solutions. An interactive research approach was used. Three major injury risks were identified and a system consisting of three tools and a handbook was developed, evaluated, and implemented at one company and made available to the construction industry."
53,"Protecting Construction Worker Health and Safety in Ontario, Canada: Identifying a Union Safety Effect",Journal of occupational and environmental medicine,2015 Dec,,"Objectives:                       Do Ontario unionized construction firms have lower workers' compensation claims rates compared with nonunion firms?                  Methods:                       Building trade and construction trade association lists of union contractors were linked to Workplace Safety and Insurance Board claims data for 2006 to 2012. Data were pooled for 2006 to 2012, and negative binomial regressions conducted with adjustment to estimate a union safety effect.                  Results:                       The sample included 5797 unionized and 38,626 nonunion construction firms. Total claims rates were 13% higher (1.13, 1.09 to 1.18) in unionized firms because of higher allowed no-lost-time claim rates (1.28, 1.23 to 1.34), whereas the lost-time claims rate was 14% lower (0.86, 0.82 to 0.91).                  Conclusions:                       Unionized construction firms compared with nonunion firms have higher no-lost-time and lower lost-time claims rates. Unionized firms may encourage occupational injury reporting and reduce risks through training and hazard identification and control strategies."
54,Psychological Constructs Related to Seat Belt Use: A Nationally Representative Survey Study,Accident; analysis and prevention,2020 Dec,,"Seat belt use can significantly reduce fatalities in motor vehicle crashes (Kahane, 2000). Nevertheless, the current U.S. seat belt use rate of 89.6% (Enriquez & Pickrell, 2019) indicates that a relatively small but pervasive portion of the population does not wear seat belts on a full-time basis. Whereas much is known about the demographic predictors of seat belt use, far less is understood about psychological factors that predict individual proclivities toward using or not using a seat belt. In this study, we examined some of these potential psychological predictors. A probability-based web survey was conducted with 6,038 U.S. residents aged 16 or older who reported having driven or ridden in a car in the past year. We measured self-reported seat belt use and 18 psychological constructs and found that delay of gratification, life satisfaction, risk aversion, risk perception, and resistance to peer influence were positively associated with belt use. Impulsivity and social resistance orientation were negatively associated with belt use. Prior research has shown that psychological factors like delay of gratification, risk aversion/perception, and impulsivity predict other health behaviors (e.g., cigarette smoking, sunscreen use); our results extend this literature to seat belts and can aid the development of traffic safety programs targeted at non-users who-due to such factors-may be resistant to more traditional countermeasures such as legislation and enforcement."
55,Crash severity effects of adaptive signal control technology: An empirical assessment with insights from Pennsylvania and Virginia,Accident; analysis and prevention,2019 Mar,,"Adaptive signal control technology (ASCT) is an intelligent transportation systems (ITS) technology that optimizes signal timings in real time to improve corridor flow. While a few past studies have examined the impact of ASCT on crash frequency, little is known about its effect on injury severity outcomes. Similarly, the impact of different types of ASCTs deployed across different states is also uncertain. This paper therefore, used ordered probit models with random parameters to estimate the injury severity outcomes resulting from ASCT deployment across Pennsylvania and Virginia. Two disparate systems deployed across the two different states were analyzed to assess whether they had similar impacts on injury severity, although signal timings are optimized using different algorithms by both systems. The estimation results revealed that both ASCT systems were associated with reductions in injury severity levels. Marginal effects showed that Type A ASCT systems reduced the propensity of severe plus moderate and minor injury crashes by 11.70% and 10.36% while type B ASCT reduced the propensity of severe plus moderate and minor injury crashes by 4.39% and 6.92%. Similarly, the ASCTs deployed across the two states were also observed to reduce injury severities. The combined best fit model also revealed a similar trend towards reductions in severe plus moderate and minor injury crashes by 5.24% and 9.91%. This model performed well on validation data with a low forecast error of 0.301 and was also observed to be spatially transferable. These results encourage the consideration of ASCT deployments at intersections with high crash severities and have practical implications for aiding agencies in making future deployment decisions about ASCT."
56,The effectiveness and safety of pharmacological prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism in patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury: A systematic review and meta-analysis,The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,2016 Sep,,"Background:                       Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common, potentially fatal complication after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis in moderate to severe TBI patients, and its use in hospitals.                  Data sources:                       A systematic review of the literature was conducted using Medline, Embase, Central database, Google scholar, and the SciELO from 1966 to 2014.                  Study selection & data extraction:                       All studies providing information on the following variables-use of VTE prophylaxis (both pharmacological and nonpharmacological), initiation of treatment, application of specific protocols, rates of VTE and hemorrhagic progression of the traumatic brain injury on computed tomographic scan-were included. The random effects model was used to calculate pooled effect estimates. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the Cochran Q homogeneity test. A forest plot was constructed, and aggregate odds ratio was computed. Potential publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots.                  Methods & main results:                       A total of 12 retrospective observational studies were identified, totaling 8,747 patients. Six studies (3,325 patients) were used to analyze the safety and five (2,105 patients) to analyze the effectiveness of pharmacological versus nonpharmacological prophylaxis, without considering the timing of treatment. Four studies (1,371 patients) were used to evaluate early versus late pharmacologic prophylaxis, with results favoring early administration (odds ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.88; p < 0.05; I, 46%) and showing no significant differences regarding safety. Three studies (4,133 patients), used to analyze VTE prophylaxis protocols, showed significant heterogeneity (p < 0.01).                  Conclusion:                       When we compared mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis, the results were heterogeneous; and thus, their potential differences could not be assessed. In some studies, the introduction of prophylaxis protocols in neurocritical patient care improved their effectiveness. Early pharmacologic prophylaxis, in the first 72 hours after TBI, was more effective than late, when there was no hemorrhagic progression within 24 hours after injury; no significant differences were found regarding safety.                  Level of evedince:                       Systematic review/meta-analysis, level III."
57,Epidemiology of injuries treated at a hand and microsurgery hospital,Acta orthopaedica et traumatologica turcica,2010,,"Objectives:                       The aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiology of injuries treated at a hand and microsurgery hospital between 1992 and 2005.                  Methods:                       This is a descriptive retrospective study based on medical records of a hand and microsurgery hospital in İzmir for the years 1992-2005. A total of 8,946 injuries involving 8,817 patients were included. Data on diagnosis were recorded according to ICD-10. Intent, activity when injured, mechanism of injury, object/substance producing injury, and place of injury were recoded according to International Classification of External Causes of Injury (ICECI).                  Results:                       The most common types of injury were amputations (32.3%), fractures (23.7%), and open wounds (19.9%) of the wrist and hand. Most injuries were sustained by males; 28.4% of injuries occurred during summer. According to activity, 76.3% were injured during paid work, 10.4% during transportation, 9.1% during unpaid work, and 3.8% during leisure time sports and exercise. Injuries most commonly occurred while operating a machine. The risk of hand injury was elevated in those younger than 35 years of age, males, persons outside İzmir province, and in Social Security Instution (SSI) insured workers (p<0.001). The riskiest activity for hand injuries was paid work. Compared to baseline, the risk of hand injuries was 29 times [95% confidence interval (CI) 16.36-50.40] as high in industrial or construction areas, and 50 times (95% CI 17.29-143.96) as high in commercial places                  Conclusion:                       Hand injuries are important because of their consequences, such as permanent disability and their high treatment costs. This study points out many important risk factors, and has contributed the development of hypotheses about injury types, under-notification of occupational injuries, and child labour. The inclusion of medical records from such specialized hospitals into national databases will aid in the prevention of these injuries, and induce developments in diagnosis and treatment."
58,Dexmedetomidine alleviates blunt chest trauma and hemorrhagic shock‑resuscitation‑induced acute lung injury through inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome,Molecular medicine reports,2020 Sep,,"Blunt chest trauma with hemorrhagic shock frequently induces pulmonary inflammation that leads to acute lung injury (ALI). The present study aimed to explore the protective effects of dexmedetomidine (Dex) in blunt chest trauma and hemorrhagic shock‑resuscitation (THSR)‑induced ALI by mediating nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain‑like receptor family pyrin domain‑containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome formation in rats. An ALI model in rats induced by THSR was constructed and Dex was administered intraperitoneally (5 µg/kg/h) immediately after blunt chest trauma. Blood samples were collected for the determination of proinflammatory factor levels, and lung tissue specimens were harvested for wet/dry (W/D) weight ratio, hematoxylin and eosin staining, and transmission electron microscopy analyses. Additionally, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were evaluated, and the expression of protein in lung tissues was examined via western blot analysis. Compared with the sham group, pathological alterations in the ALI group and the W/D ratios were significantly increased. MDA, LDH and MPO activity, and the levels of interleukin (IL)‑1β, IL‑18, IL‑6 and tumor necrosis factor‑α were significantly elevated. NLRP3, apoptosis‑associated speck‑like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain and caspase‑1 expression was significantly increased. Conversely, Dex treatment significantly reversed these changes. The present study demonstrated that by reducing inflammatory responses, Dex exerted protective effects against THSR‑ALI in rats, potentially via the inhibition of NLRP3 signaling pathways."
59,Occupational burns treated in emergency departments,American journal of industrial medicine,2015 Mar,,"Background:                       Despite reported declines, occupational burn injuries remain a workplace safety concern. More severe burns may result in costly medical treatment and long-term physical and psychological consequences.                  Methods:                       We used the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-Occupational Supplement to produce national estimates of burns treated in emergency departments (EDs). We analyzed data trends from 1999 to 2008 and provided detailed descriptions of 2008 data.                  Results:                       From 1999 to 2008 there were 1,132,000 (95% CI: ±192,300) nonfatal occupational burns treated in EDs. Burn numbers and rates declined approximately 40% over the 10 years. In 2008, men and younger workers 15-24 years old had the highest rates. Scalds and thermal burns accounted for more than 60% of burns. Accommodation and food service, manufacturing, and construction industries had the largest number of burns.                  Conclusions:                       Despite declining burn rates, emphasis is needed on reducing burn hazards to young food service workers and using job specific hazard analyses to prevent burns."
60,A 10-step safety management framework for construction small and medium-sized enterprises,International journal of occupational safety and ergonomics : JOSE,2017 Sep,,It is of great importance to develop an occupational health and safety management system (OHS MS) to form a systemized approach to improve health and safety. It is a known fact that thousands of accidents and injuries occur in the construction industry. Most of these accidents occur in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This article provides a 10-step user-friendly OHS MS for the construction industry. A quantitative OHS MS indexing method is also introduced in the article. The practical application of the system to real SMEs and its promising results are also presented.
61,GC-MS based metabolomic profiling of lung tissue couple with network pharmacology revealed the possible protection mechanism of Pudilan Xiaoyan Oral Liquid in LPS-induced lung injury of mice,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2020 Apr,,"Pudilan Xiaoyan Oral Liquid (PDL) originated from ""Pudilan"" Classic Recipe of traditional Chinese medicine is one kind of anti-inflammatory Chinese patent medicine recorded in Chinese Pharmacopeia. PDL has been used clinically for treating inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract. However, due to the complex composition of PDL, its potential anti-inflammation and the mechanism remain unknown. To identify the mechanism of the PDL in the treatment of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury of mice. The mice models of lung injury were established and the changes of biochemical indices in serum and histopathology were detected to explore the effects of PDL. The approach of GC-MS metabolomics was used to find more significant metabolites, and the metabolic pathways were enriched through MetaboAnalyst. Then network analysis was applied to visualize the protein related to the important metabolites, merging into a protein-metabolite network via Cytoscape. The treatment of PDL could attenuate LPS-induced histopathological damage of lung tissues, followed by reducing pro-inflammation mediators including IL-10, TNF-a and NF-ĸB in serum. 11 potential metabolites were identified in lung tissue through metabolomics, which were significantly regulated to recover by PDL treatment. The correlated network was constructed by integrating potential metabolites and pathways. Aspartate and l-cysteine were selected as key metabolites and correlated proteins such as IL4I1 and ASPA were speculated as the potential target to treat LPS-induced lung injury using PDL. These results demonstrated that PDL might prevent the pathological process of lung injury through regulating the disturbed protein-metabolite network."
62,Variability of child access prevention laws and pediatric firearm injuries,The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,2018 Apr,,"Background:                       State-level child access prevention (CAP) laws impose criminal liability on adults who negligently allow children access to firearms. The CAP laws can be further divided into strong CAP laws which impose criminal liability for negligently stored firearms and weak CAP laws that prohibit adults from intentionally, knowingly, and/or recklessly providing firearms to a minor. We hypothesized that strong CAP laws would be associated with a greater reduction in pediatric firearm injuries than weak CAP laws.                  Methods:                       We constructed a cross-sectional national study using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project-Kids Inpatient Database from 2006 and 2009 using weighted counts of firearm-related admissions among children younger than 18 years. Poisson regression was used to estimate the association of CAP laws with pediatric firearm injuries.                  Results:                       After adjusting for race, sex, age, and socioeconomic income quartile, strong CAP laws were associated with a significant reduction in all (incidence rate ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.93), self-inflicted (incidence rate ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-0.79), and unintentional (incidence rate ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.43-0.74) pediatric firearm injuries. Weak CAP laws, which only impose liability for reckless endangerment, were associated with an increased risk of all pediatric firearm injuries.                  Conclusion:                       The association of CAP laws on hospitalizations for pediatric firearm injuries differed greatly depending on whether a state had adopted a strong CAP law or a weak CAP law. Implementation of strong CAP laws by each state, which require safe storage of firearms, has the potential to significantly reduce pediatric firearm injuries.                  Level of evidence:                       Prognostic and epidemiology study, level III."
63,Mechanical properties of protective spectacles fitted with corrective lenses,International journal of occupational safety and ergonomics : JOSE,2017 Sep,,"The majority of commercially available corrective spectacles used by workers do not provide effective eye protection against mechanical hazards in the workplace. One of the risks commonly occurring during work is hitting the head on some protruding elements, such as components of machines, buildings or tree branches in a forest. Because of the considerable weight of the human head and the speed of movement during impact, this type of accident may be very serious. This article presents a method of testing the mechanical strength of corrective lenses, simulating the results of an impact of the head on elements of workplaces. The results of tests of commercially available materials used for the construction of corrective and protective spectacles are also presented and discussed."
64,Development of a PHMB hydrogel-modified wound scaffold dressing with antibacterial activity,Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society,2020 Jul,,"Current wound scaffold dressing constructs can facilitate wound healing but do not exhibit antibacterial activity, resulting in high infection rates. We aimed to endow wound scaffold dressing with anti-infective ability by polyhexamethylenebiguanide (PHMB). We prepared PHMB hydrogel at varying concentrations (0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%) and assessed release and cytotoxicity. PHMB hydrogel was added to the wound scaffold dressing to generate a PHMB hydrogel-modified wound scaffold dressing. Wound healing and infection prevention were evaluated using a full-thickness skin defect model in rats. In vitro, the hydrogel PHMB release time positively correlated with PHMB concentration, with 1% allowing sufficiently long release time to encompass the high-incidence period (3-5 days) of infection following wound scaffold dressing implantation. Implantation of 1% PHMB hydrogel into the skin did not cause adverse responses. in vitro cytotoxicity assays showed the PHMB hydrogel-modified wound scaffold dressing did not significantly affect proliferation of fibroblasts or vascular endothelial cells, 99.90% vs 99.84% for fibroblasts and 100.21% vs 99.28% for vascular endothelial cells at 21 days. Transplantation of PHMB hydrogel-modified wound scaffold dressing/unmodified wound scaffold dressing on the non-infected wounds of rats yielded no significant difference in relative vascularization rate, 47.40 vs 50.87 per view at 21 days, whereas bacterial content of the wound tissue in the PHMB hydrogel-modified wound scaffold dressing group was significantly lower than the unmodified wound scaffold dressing group, (1.80 ± 0.35) × 103 vs (9.34 ± 0.45) × 103 at 14 days. Prevalence of persistent wound infection in the rats receiving PHMB hydrogel-modified wound scaffold dressing transplantation onto infected wounds was significantly lower than the unmodified wound scaffold dressing group, 30% vs 100%. PHMB hydrogel-modified wound scaffold dressing exhibited suitable antibacterial ability, and its biological activity did not significantly differ from that of the unmodified wound scaffold dressing, thereby allowing it to effectively prevent infection following wound scaffold dressing implantation."
65,Calculation of an Optic Nerve Injury Risk Profile Before Sphenoid Sinus Surgery,The Journal of craniofacial surgery,2017 Jan,,"Objectives:                       Our objective was to analyze variations in the optic nerve (ON) course and surrounding structures in an effort to construct an optic nerve injury risk profile before endoscopic intranasal sphenoidal, or endoscopic endonasal transphenoidal, skull-base surgery, and eventually to construct and formulate a common classification by combining the known classes. The authors used computed tomography (CT) toward this end.                  Methods:                       The authors retrospectively reviewed 200 consecutive CT scans (400 sides) of the paranasal sinuses. The pneumatization of the anterior clinoid process, the relationships of the ONs to the sphenoidal sinuses, and ON dehiscence were evaluated. The authors then created a formula by which risk profiles can be constructed for patients for whom sphenoid or parasellar surgery is planned.                  Results:                       Pneumatization of the anterior clinoid process was evident in 28.25%. Dehiscence of the bony wall of the ON was evident in 9.5%. The ON course lay adjacent to the sphenoidal sinus, causing sinus wall indentation, in 23%. Cumulative optic nerve injury risk scoring showed that, radiologically, surgery on 8.5% and 1.5% of sphenoid sinuses described here carried severe or critical risk of ON injury, respectively.                  Conclusions:                       Head-and-neck surgeons and neurosurgeons should be aware of variations in ON course. The authors composed an optic nerve injury risk classification category based on the sum of individual weights of each of these classes. Reductions in ON injuries require careful evaluation of potential variant anatomies. Preoperative CT scans must be meticulously reviewed to avoid ON injury."
66,"Occupational ladder fall injuries - United States, 2011",MMWR. Morbidity and mortality weekly report,2014 Apr 25,,"Falls remain a leading cause of unintentional injury mortality nationwide [corrected].Among workers, approximately 20% of fall injuries involve ladders. Among construction workers, an estimated 81% of fall injuries treated in U.S. emergency departments (EDs) involve a ladder. To fully characterize fatal and nonfatal injuries associated with ladder falls among workers in the United States, CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) analyzed data across multiple surveillance systems: 1) the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI), 2) the Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses (SOII), and 3) the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-occupational supplement (NEISS-Work). In 2011, work-related ladder fall injuries (LFIs) resulted in 113 fatalities (0.09 per 100,000 full-time equivalent [FTE] workers), an estimated 15,460 nonfatal injuries reported by employers that involved ≥1 days away from work (DAFW), and an estimated 34,000 nonfatal injuries treated in EDs. Rates for nonfatal, work-related, ED-treated LFIs were higher (2.6 per 10,000 FTE) than those for such injuries reported by employers (1.2 per 10,000 FTE). LFIs represent a substantial public health burden of preventable injuries for workers. Because falls are the leading cause of work-related injuries and deaths in construction, NIOSH, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the Center for Construction Research and Training are promoting a national campaign to prevent workplace falls. NIOSH is also developing innovative technologies to complement safe ladder use."
67,Electrical deaths in the US construction: an analysis of fatality investigations,International journal of injury control and safety promotion,2014,,"Electrocution is among the 'fatal four' in US construction according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Learning from failures is believed to be an effective path to success, with deaths being the most serious system failures. This paper examined the failures in electrical safety by analysing all electrical fatality investigations (N = 132) occurring between 1989 and 2010 from the Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation programme that is completed by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. Results reveal the features of the electrical fatalities in construction and disclose the most common electrical safety challenges on construction sites. This research also suggests the sociotechnical system breakdowns and the less effectiveness of current safety training programmes may significantly contribute to worker's unsafe behaviours and electrical fatality occurrences."
68,The use of actor-based immersive health and safety inductions: Lessons from the Thames Tideway Tunnel megaproject,Applied ergonomics,2020 Jan,,"Health and safety inductions are ubiquitous in construction but tend to be poorly designed and suffer low levels of worker engagement. In this paper we report on the evaluation of an innovative, full day, actor-based health and safety induction called EPIC, currently being used on London's Thames Tideway Tunnel megaproject. As of March 2019, more than 14,000 individuals had attended EPIC. This evaluation examines the impact of EPIC from the perspective of participants and other stakeholders, and considers the utility of actor-based immersive health and safety inductions for use more widely, in both construction and other sectors. Using a mixed-method, longitudinal approach to data collection, EPIC is evaluated against Kirkpatrick's (1959) 'four levels' framework of reactions, learning, behaviour change and results. This paper discusses factors which support and hinder actor-based inductions, and the challenges involved in assessing the impact of inductions on subsequent behaviour and health and safety outcomes."
69,Empirical Bayes before-after evaluation of horizontal curve warning pavement markings on two-lane rural highways in Pennsylvania,Accident; analysis and prevention,2020 Oct,,"Roadway departure crashes contribute to a large proportion of fatal and injury crashes in the United States. These crash types are more likely to occur along horizontal curve sections of a roadway. Countermeasures that prevent vehicles from departing the roadway is one method to mitigate roadway departure crashes. Pennsylvania has deployed on-pavement horizontal curve warning markings in advance of horizontal curves on two-lane rural highways as a roadway departure crash reduction strategy. This study used an Empirical Bayes (EB) before-after study design to evaluate the safety effects of the horizontal curve warning pavement markings. A total of 263 treatment sites and more than 21,000 reference sites were included in the evaluation. Crash modification factors were developed for total, fatal plus injury, run-off-road, nighttime, nighttime run-off-road, and nighttime fatal plus injury crashes. The point estimates for each of these crashes ranged from 0.65 to 0.77 - the results were statistically significant for total and fatal plus injury crashes at the 95th-percentile confidence level."
70,A training intervention to improve frontline construction leaders' safety leadership practices and overall jobsite safety climate,Journal of safety research,2019 Sep,,"Introduction:                       The 2.5 h Foundations for Safety Leadership (FSL) training program teaches construction supervisors the leadership skills they need to strengthen jobsite safety climate and reduce adverse safety-related outcomes.                  Methods:                       Using a quasi-experimental prospective switching replications study design, we examined (1) if FSL-trained jobsite safety leaders would report improved understanding and practice of the FSL leadership skills, safety practices and crew reporting of safety related conditions, and (2) if their crew perceived a change in (a) their supervisors' practices, (b) their own safety practices and reporting of safety-related conditions, and (c) overall jobsite safety climate. Twenty construction sub-contracting companies were recruited and randomly assigned to either an early or lagged-control training group. Participating supervisors and workers completed surveys at multiple time points before and after the FSL training. We used linear mixed modeling to test changes over time.                  Results:                       Only supervisors in the early group reported a statistically significant improvement in their understanding and practice of the leadership skills as well as safety practices from before to 2- and 4-weeks post-training. Overall, no significant change was detected in crew-reported outcomes from before to after their supervisors' participated in the FSL training.                  Conclusions:                       These results provide evidence that the FSL training can, at least in the short-term, improve construction frontline leaders' jobsite leadership skills. Future research could include an evaluation of FSL refresher activities and a longer-term follow-up. Practical applications: The Foundations for Safety Leadership (FSL) program fills an identified need for construction frontline supervisors to learn and practice critical safety leadership skills on the jobsite. It has already reached over 60,000 leaders and has the potential to reach over 100,000 each year during either an OSHA 30-h or a stand-alone course."
71,An Alternative Technique for External Fixation of Traumatic Intra-articular Fractures of Proximal and Middle Phalanx,Techniques in hand & upper extremity surgery,2015 Dec,,"Background:                       Intra-articular fractures of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint are commonly treated with dynamic external fixation. Most commonly used is the Suzuki modification of the pins and rubber traction system (PRTS). There are a few other modifications of the PRTS external fixators. We present an alternative pin external fixator that is simple and effective.                  Methods:                       Under a suitable anesthesia and image intensification a true lateral view of the head of the proximal phalanx is obtained. A K-wire construct holds the affected digit out to length with the fracture reduced and Jurgan pin-balls hold the construct into position. Under image intensification the whole device is checked to ensure the joint and fracture is reduced and the joint is not over distracted. The PIP joint is also checked to ensure good range of motion. The device was checked in clinic at 1 week with radiographs. The wires are removed at 4 weeks followed by intensive hand physiotherapy.                  Results:                       Over 20 patients with intra-articular fractures of the proximal and middle phalangeal were treated with this technique. In all cases the fracture healed with good joint congruency. All patients achieved good range of motion of the PIP joint but with some restriction of full flexion (mean, 20 degrees). There was no loss of position or pin-site infections. There was good compliance with the treatment.                  Discussion:                       The main advantages of the technique we describe are: (1) the compact design, making it less cumbersome for the patient compared with other PRTS external fixators; (2) it is straightforward to assemble and the device is easy to adjust in clinic if there is any loss of reduction; (3) the pin-balls prevent sharp ends of the wire protruding causing morbidity to the patient; (4) there is less chance of loss of traction compared with traction devices using rubber bands. It is a dynamic device, which allows mobilization of the joints reducing stiffness."
72,The Safety Climate Assessment Tool (S-CAT): A rubric-based approach to measuring construction safety climate,Journal of safety research,2019 Jun,,"Introduction:                       This paper presents the development and validation of a new rubric-based Safety Climate Assessment Tool (S-CAT). The S-CAT gives companies the opportunity to use rubric descriptors, rather than traditional Likert scale responses, to self-assess their level of safety climate maturity and receive a composite score benchmarked against others in the S-CAT database.                  Method:                       The S-CAT is composed of 37 separate indicators of 8 safety climate factors identified by construction industry subject matter experts. The eight factors have between three and six indicators each with its own rubric-based response-scale. The scales comprise descriptors for five levels of safety climate maturity ranging from ""inattentive"" to ""exemplary."" Nine hundred and eighty-five respondents working in the construction industry completed the S-CAT via our online safety climate website. We used company recordable incident rates (RIR) to assess the S-CAT's criterion-related validity.                  Results:                       Cronbach alphas for each factor ranged from 0.77 to 0.90 and a confirmatory factor analysis supported the hypothesized eight factor structure with a higher-order safety climate factor. Seven of the eight factor scores, as well as the overall S-CAT score, were significantly negatively correlated with RIR. Moreover, a relative weights analysis indicated that a weighted combination of the eight safety climate factors explained 27% of the variance in organizational RIR.                  Conclusions:                       These findings provide evidence that the S-CAT is a reliable tool allowing construction companies to self-assess their safety climate along eight different factors. Moreover, the S-CAT was significantly associated with organizational injury rates. Practical applications: We discuss how companies can use the rubric descriptors to strengthen their safety management systems and improve their safety climate maturity."
73,Triage tools for detecting cervical spine injury in pediatric trauma patients,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2017 Dec 7,,"Background:                       Pediatric cervical spine injury (CSI) after blunt trauma is rare. Nonetheless, missing these injuries can have severe consequences. To prevent the overuse of radiographic imaging, two clinical decision tools have been developed: The National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS) criteria and the Canadian C-spine Rule (CCR). Both tools are proven to be accurate in deciding whether or not diagnostic imaging is needed in adults presenting for blunt trauma screening at the emergency department. However, little information is known about the accuracy of these triage tools in a pediatric population.                  Objectives:                       To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the NEXUS criteria and the Canadian C-spine Rule in a pediatric population evaluated for CSI following blunt trauma.                  Search methods:                       We searched the following databases to 24 February 2015: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, MEDLINE Non-Indexed and In-Process Citations, PubMed, Embase, Science Citation Index, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Database, OpenGrey, ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, the Health Technology Assessment, and the Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility.                  Selection criteria:                       We included all retrospective and prospective studies involving children following blunt trauma that evaluated the accuracy of the NEXUS criteria, the Canadian C-spine Rule, or both. Plain radiography, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine, and follow-up were considered as adequate reference standards.                  Data collection and analysis:                       Two review authors independently assessed the quality of included studies using the QUADAS-2 checklists. They extracted data on study design, patient characteristics, inclusion and exclusion criteria, clinical parameters, target condition, reference standard, and the diagnostic two-by-two table. We calculated and plotted sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value in ROC space, and constructed forest plots for visual examination of variation in test accuracy.                  Main results:                       Three cohort studies were eligible for analysis, including 3380 patients ; 96 children were diagnosed with CSI. One study evaluated the accuracy of the Canadian C-spine Rule and the NEXUS criteria, and two studies evaluated the accuracy of the NEXUS criteria. The studies were of moderate quality. Due to the small number of included studies and the diverse outcomes of those studies, we could not describe a pooled estimate for the diagnostic test accuracy. The sensitivity of the NEXUS criteria of the individual studies was 0.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.90), 0.98 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.00) and 1.00 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.00). The specificity of the NEXUS criteria was 0.35 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.45), 0.54 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.62) and 0.2 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.21). For the Canadian C-spine Rule the sensitivity was 0.86 (95% CI 0.42 to 1.00) and specificity was 0.15 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.23). Since the quantity of the data was small we were not able to investigate heterogeneity.                  Authors' conclusions:                       There are currently few studies assessing the diagnostic test accuracy of the NEXUS criteria and CCR in children. At the moment, there is not enough evidence to determine the accuracy of the Canadian C-spine Rule to detect CSI in pediatric trauma patients following blunt trauma. The confidence interval of the sensitivity of the NEXUS criteria between the individual studies showed a wide range, with a lower limit varying from 0.18 to 0.91 with a total of four false negative test results, meaning that if physicians use the NEXUS criteria in children, there is a chance of missing CSI. Since missing CSI could have severe consequences with the risk of significant morbidity, we consider that the NEXUS criteria are at best a guide to clinical assessment, with current evidence not supporting strict or protocolized adoption of the tool into pediatric trauma care. Moreover, we have to keep in mind that the sensitivity differs among several studies, and individual confidence intervals of these studies show a wide range. Our main conclusion is therefore that additional well-designed studies with large sample sizes are required to better evaluate the accuracy of the NEXUS criteria or the Canadian C-spine Rule, or both, in order to determine whether they are appropriate triage tools for the clearance of the cervical spine in children following blunt trauma."
74,Generating stability in elderly acetabular fractures-A biomechanical assessment,Injury,2017 Oct,,"Background & objectives:                       As the overall health and life expectancy increases in the United States, the incidence of fragility fractures in elderly patients also continues to increase. Given their medical comorbidities and decreased bone mineral density, acetabular fractures in the elderly population present a significant challenge to the orthopaedic trauma surgeon. The anterior column posterior hemitransverse (ACPHT) fracture pattern is a common fracture pattern in this population, and is often associated with central subluxation/dislocation of the femoral head with articular impaction. This study sought to delineate the most stable fixation construct in ACPHT fracture patterns in the elderly population.                  Materials and methods:                       The sample consisted of 3 groups of synthetic hemipelves (N=15), which were tested in order to compare stiffness by measuring motion at fracture lines under applied loads. The three groups of unique quadrilateral plate fixation were as follows: a specialty quadrilateral surface plate; 4 long peri-articular screws parallel to the quadrilateral surface into the ischium,; and an 8 hole infrapectineal buttress plate. Digital imaging system measured construct motion under load. Construct stiffness was estimated by linear regression of load between 50 and 850N versus average relative motion (average of relative motion at 200 points along the line of the osteotomy). Permanent deformation was estimated as the magnitude of relative motion upon unloading.                  Results:                       Using ANOVA with Tukey's test to determine construct stiffness in loading, the group long peri-articular screws was found to have significantly higher stiffness than either of the other groups. Maximal fracture displacement was located at the intersection of the low transverse fracture line in the posterior column and the free quadrilateral surface fragment.                  Conclusions:                       Results indicate that the best fixation construct for this ACPHT acetabular fracture pattern includes independent lag screws across the anterior column and a pelvic brim plate with long periarticular screws maximizing posterior column fixation and preventing medialization of the free quadrilateral fragment. Although there are potential patient considerations that may complicate the placement of all 4 long screws, in most patients one or more of these screws can be safely placed in order to help prevent secondary displacement."
75,Nail gun injuries to the head with minimal neurological consequences: a case series,Journal of medical case reports,2016 Mar 16,,"Background:                       An estimated 3700 individuals are seen annually in US emergency departments for nail gun-related injuries. Approximately 45 cases have been reported in the literature concerning nail gun injuries penetrating the cranium. These cases pose a challenge for the neurosurgeon because of the uniqueness of each case, the dynamics of high pressure nail gun injuries, and the surgical planning to remove the foreign body without further vascular injury or uncontrolled intracranial hemorrhage.                  Case presentation:                       Here we present four cases of penetrating nail gun injuries with variable presentations. Case 1 is of a 33-year-old white man who sustained 10 nail gunshot injuries to his head. Case 2 is of a 51-year-old white man who sustained bi-temporal nail gun injuries to his head. Cases 3 and 4 are of two white men aged 22 years and 49 years with a single nail gun injury to the head. In the context of these individual cases and a review of similar cases in the literature we present surgical approaches and considerations in the management of nail gun injuries to the cranium. Case 1 presented with cranial nerve deficits, Case 2 required intubation for low Glasgow Coma Scale, while Cases 3 and 4 were neurologically intact on presentation. Three patients underwent angiography for assessment of vascular injury and all patients underwent surgical removal of foreign objects using a vice-grip. No neurological deficits were found in these patients on follow-up.                  Conclusions:                       Nail gun injuries can present with variable clinical status; mortality and morbidity is low for surgically managed isolated nail gun-related injuries to the head. The current case series describes the surgical use of a vice-grip for a good grip of the nail head and controlled extraction, and these patients appear to have a good postoperative prognosis with minimal neurological deficits postoperatively and on follow-up."
76,A 5-Year Review of Pavement Burns From a Desert Burn Center,Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association,2019 Jun 21,,"Pavement burns account for significant burn-related injuries in the Southwestern United States and other hot climates with nearly continuous sunlight and daily maximum temperatures above 100°F. At peak temperatures, pavement can be hot enough to cause second-degree burns in a matter of seconds. The goal of this study was to review pavement burn injury admissions at a desert burn center compared with maximum ambient temperatures to determine which temperatures correlated to an increase in burn admissions. We obtained ambient temperature data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. We reviewed our registry for 5 years retrospectively of all pavement burn injury admissions to our burn center. A total of 173 pavement-related burn cases were identified. We demonstrated an exponential increase in the rate of burn admissions as maximum ambient temperatures increased. More than 88% of pavement-related burn injury admissions occurred when the ambient temperature reached 95°F or higher. The risk per day was extrapolated based on the number of pavement burn injury admissions and the number of days at each of the maximum ambient temperatures recorded. The risk of pavement burns in areas of direct sunlight begins around 95°F and increases exponentially as ambient temperatures rise. This information will be used for burn outreach prevention and public health awareness programs. The benefit of this study relates to the entire community since high ambient temperatures put everyone at risk for hot pavement burns."
77,Analysis of the impact of health and safety coordinator on construction site accidents: The case of Spain,Journal of safety research,2019 Feb,,"The figure of the Health and Safety Coordinator (HSC), as a necessary and competent engineer in the construction sector, emerged in Spain on December 25, 1997 as a result of the implementation of European Directive 92/57/EEC. The coming of age of this figure is a sufficient period of time for determining its implementation and impact within the construction sector. The research carried out in this article arose from the analysis of statistical data obtained through Public Authorities and Professional Bodies. The quantitative study of the data extracted is complemented by the creation of specific benchmark indicators which connect four fundamental variables in the construction industry: the number of accidents, volume of workers employed, building units, and health and safety coordination posts. Furthermore, the legislation governing the HSC engineer in each of the 28 Member States of the European Union is studied. The results show a high implementation rate for the figure of the HSC, as well as a positive impact in relation to the reduced accident rate in the construction sector. Likewise, an update to the procedures of the various authorities is considered to be necessary in order to make the data concerning the actual work of the health and safety coordinators public. Finally, a review of the Spanish legislation concerning the HSC Coordinator is considered to be inevitable, in order to bring it up to the levels of professional skill and competence defined by the majority of European Union Member States."
78,Buddies in bad times? the role of co-workers after a work-related injury,Journal of occupational rehabilitation,2013 Sep,,"Introduction:                       Co-workers can play an important role after a work-related injury. They can provide details about the circumstances of an accident, offer emotional support to the injured worker and help with job tasks upon a co-worker's return to work (RTW). Working with an injured co-worker, however, can also strain work relationships and increase workload. The purpose of this study was to determine the role that co-workers play after a work-related injury and during the RTW process in the unionized, electrical construction sector.                  Methods:                       We conducted two focus groups with injured electricians and union representatives. We also interviewed co-workers who had worked with someone who had been injured in the course of employment. We examined the role that co-workers can play after a work-related injury and some of the factors facilitating and hindering co-worker support.                  Results:                       The structure of work in the electrical sector-a focus on cost-cutting and competition, job insecurity, perceptions of ""different camps"" among co-workers, little modified work and poor formal communication-can impede co-worker support and contribute to making injured workers' experiences difficult. Management can play an important role in setting an example for how injured workers are regarded and treated.                  Conclusions:                       Future research should explore how workers can better be supported after a work-related injury and during the RTW process."
79,Health professionals' perceptions of musculoskeletal injury and injury risk factors in Australian triathletes: a factor analysis,Physical therapy in sport : official journal of the Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Sports Medicine,2013 Nov,,"Objective:                       This study investigated health professional perceptions of triathlon-related injury risk factors and injury prevention strategies, to inform prospective cohort studies investigating injury in triathletes.                  Design:                       Exploratory factor analysis.                  Methods:                       A questionnaire was developed and distributed to Australian sports medicine health professionals (n = 504). Information was collected about their perceptions of factors contributing to injury and injury prevention strategies relating to Sprint/Olympic (S/O) and Ironman/Long Course (I/LC) athletes. Factor analysis was performed to identify the number and nature of the constructs (factors) underlying the responses to the questions, and to ascertain whether these factors were similar for S/O and I/LC athletes.                  Results:                       The response rate was 22.4% (n = 113). Five factors were extracted for injury risk accounting for 53% (S/O) and 56% (I/LC) of the variance. The factors were common across S/O and I/LC groups; biomechanics and technique, training factors, demographics, injury prevention and personal factors. Three common factors accounted for 54% (S/O) and 55% (I/LC) of the variance for injury prevention strategies; designated training regimes, health and medical monitoring and preparation of the triathlete.                  Conclusions:                       These results indicate that future studies into triathlon injuries should include, at a minimum, detailed training load and demographic factors to test their impact as injury risk factors in triathlete populations."
80,The evolution of a purpose designed hybrid trauma operating room from the trauma service perspective: the RAPTOR (Resuscitation with Angiography Percutaneous Treatments and Operative Resuscitations),Injury,2014 Sep,,"Traumatic injury is the leading cause of potentially preventable lost years of life in the Western world and exsanguination is the most potentially preventable cause of post-traumatic death. With mature trauma systems and experienced trauma centres, extra-abdominal sites, such as the pelvis, constitute the most frequent anatomic site of exsanguination. Haemorrhage control for such bleeding often requires surgical adjuncts most notably interventional radiology (IR). With the usual paradigm of surgery conducted within an operating room and IR procedures within distant angiography suites, responsible clinicians are faced with making difficult decisions regarding where to transport the most physiologically unstable patients for haemorrhage control. If such a critical patient is transported to the wrong suite, they may die unnecessarily despite having potentially salvageable injuries. Thus, it seems only logical that the resuscitative operating room of the future would have IR capabilities making it the obvious geographic destination for critically unstable patients, especially those who are exsanguinating. Our trauma programme recently had the opportunity to conceive, design, build, and operationalise a purpose-designed hybrid trauma operating room, designated as the resuscitation with angiographic percutaneous techniques and operative resuscitation (RAPTOR) suite, which we believe to be the first such resource designed primarily to serve the exsanguinating trauma patient. The project was initiated after consultations between the trauma programme and private philanthropists regarding the greatest potential impacts on regional trauma care. The initial capital construction costs were thus privately generated but coincided with a new hospital wing construction allowing the RAPTOR to be purpose-designed for the exsanguinating patient. Many trauma programmes around the world are now starting to navigate the complex process of building new facilities, or else retrofitting existing ones, to address the need for single-site flexible haemorrhage control. This manuscript therefore describes the many considerations in the design and refinement of the physical build, equipment selection, human factors evaluation of new combined treatment paradigms, and the final introduction of a RAPTOR protocol in order that others may learn from our initial efforts."
81,Fewer workers' compensation claims and lower claim costs if employers with high injury rates achieved the rates of their safer peers,Journal of safety research,2019 Sep,,"Introduction:                       Employers engaged in similar business activities demonstrate a range of workers' compensation claim rates. Workplace injuries and illnesses could be prevented if employers with high claim rates achieved the claim rates of their safer peers.                  Methods:                       We used Washington workers' compensation claims data for years 2013-2015 to calculate rates of compensable claims (eligible for disability or time loss benefits, if unable to work four days after injury) and total accepted claims (compensable plus medical-aid only claims) for each employer. We estimated the number and cost of claims to occur if employers with high claim rates reduced them to the rates of employers at the 25th percentile, adjusted for insurance risk class, employer size, and injury type. To evaluate the impact of setting more or less ambitious goals, we also estimated reductions based on claim rates at the 10th and 50th percentiles.                  Results:                       Over 43% of claims and claim costs would be prevented if employers with higher claim rates lowered them to the 25th percentile using either total accepted or compensable claim rates as the benchmark outcome. The estimated claim cost savings from benchmarking to compensable claims was nearly as great as the estimate based on benchmarking to total accepted claims ($308.5 mil annually based on compensable claims vs. $332.4 mil based on total accepted claims). Restaurants and Taverns had the greatest number of potentially prevented compensable claims. Colleges and Universities and Wood Frame and Building Construction had the greatest potential reduction in compensable claim costs among larger and smaller employers, respectively.                  Conclusion:                       Substantial reductions in workers' compensation claims and costs are possible if employers achieve the injury rates experienced by their safer peers. Practical application: Evaluating the range of workplace injury rates among employers within industry groups identifies opportunities for injury prevention and offers another approach to resource allocation."
82,More than training: Community-based participatory research to reduce injuries among hispanic construction workers,American journal of industrial medicine,2013 Aug,,"Background:                       Workplace mortality and severe injury are disproportionately distributed among foreign born and Hispanic construction workers. Worker Centers (WCs) provide services and advocacy for low-wage workers and a way for investigators to reach them. The goal of this project is to prevent occupational injuries by increasing awareness of hazards and self-efficacy among foreign born, Hispanic construction workers and by expanding the agenda of WCs to include occupational health and safety (H&S).                  Methods:                       Investigators partnered with eight WCs in seven cities to train worker leaders to deliver a modified OSHA 10-hr curriculum to their peers.                  Results:                       Thirty-two worker leaders trained 446 workers over 3 years. There was a demonstrated improvement in knowledge, hazard identification, self-efficacy, and sustainable H&S activities.                  Conclusions:                       This study provides evidence for successful implementation of a training intervention for low wage, low literacy Hispanic construction workers using a community-based participatory research approach."
83,Fatal injuries among Hispanic workers in the U.S. construction industry: Findings from FACE investigation reports,Journal of safety research,2018 Dec,,"Introduction:                       Identifying and understanding the characteristics of workplace accidents can provide vital information required to clarify their causes and prevent similar accidents from happening in the future. The Hispanic workforce represents a significant segment of the U.S. construction labor force that is projected to continue increasing in population. The government statistical data show higher rates of fatalities among Hispanic workers when compared to other ethnic groups.                  Method:                       This study aims to provide details about the trends of fatal injuries among Hispanic workers. The study examined 92 government investigation reports to reveal the general trends, then an examination of fatal fall injuries within the study sample was conducted since falling is the predominant cause of fatal injuries.                  Results:                       The findings suggest differences in accident characteristics between Hispanic workers and all workers, which could indicate a need for different interventions to improve the overall site safety. The study also revealed the dire need to propose revised investigation procedures that would help identify the root causes of accidents, which in turn leads to better recommendations and interventions."
84,Serious injury prediction algorithm based on large-scale data and under-triage control,Accident; analysis and prevention,2017 Jan,,"The present study was undertaken to construct an algorithm for an advanced automatic collision notification system based on national traffic accident data compiled by Japanese police. While US research into the development of a serious-injury prediction algorithm is based on a logistic regression algorithm using the National Automotive Sampling System/Crashworthiness Data System, the present injury prediction algorithm was based on comprehensive police data covering all accidents that occurred across Japan. The particular focus of this research is to improve the rescue of injured vehicle occupants in traffic accidents, and the present algorithm assumes the use of an onboard event data recorder data from which risk factors such as pseudo delta-V, vehicle impact location, seatbelt wearing or non-wearing, involvement in a single impact or multiple impact crash and the occupant's age can be derived. As a result, a simple and handy algorithm suited for onboard vehicle installation was constructed from a sample of half of the available police data. The other half of the police data was applied to the validation testing of this new algorithm using receiver operating characteristic analysis. An additional validation was conducted using in-depth investigation of accident injuries in collaboration with prospective host emergency care institutes. The validated algorithm, named the TOYOTA-Nihon University algorithm, proved to be as useful as the US URGENCY and other existing algorithms. Furthermore, an under-triage control analysis found that the present algorithm could achieve an under-triage rate of less than 10% by setting a threshold of 8.3%."
85,"Injury among migrant workers in Changning district, Shanghai, China",International journal of injury control and safety promotion,2012,,"The objective of this study was to characterise the injury epidemic and injury prevention needs of migrant workers in Shanghai. Cluster random sampling was applied in selecting subjects in migrant gathering areas, and face-to-face interview survey was conducted in this study. In this survey, 1256 migrant workers were included, among which the injury incidence in last one year was 38.3%. The first four injuries were incised and penetrating injury (9.5%), falls (7.2%), traffic injury (6.3%) and burns (5.3%). The injury incidence of male workers was significantly higher than that of female workers (χ(2) = 22.7, P < 0.01). Electricians, safeguards and construction workers were at the highest risk of getting injured. About 60.7% of injury episodes happened at a residence. The longest period of absence from work was up to 3 months due to falls, while the highest medical expense was near 9999 CNY ($1464.2) caused by traffic injury. About 62.9% of migrant workers need services on injury prevention. It is concluded that compared with urban registered residents, migrant workers have significantly higher incidence of injury in Shanghai. Injury prevention services are in urgent demand among the migrant workers."
86,Fatal head injury: a sequelae to electric shock - a case report,The Medico-legal journal,2015 Mar,,"Deaths due to electric shock are increasing despite stringent laws and preventive measures. These shocks are a leading cause of death amongst construction workers. In about 20% of the cases, no visible injury due to electricity can be seen. In some cases, non-electrical injuries are present and at times there are no eyewitnesses to provide a detailed account of events. In such circumstances, examination of scene of death, autopsy and accident reconstruction with the help of an electrical expert are all necessary to determine the cause of death. Here, we report one such case where a mason working on the second floor of a building under construction sustained an electrical injury, following which he was thrown to the ground sustaining a fatal traumatic injury. After careful consideration, his death was attributed to the head injury."
87,Experimental study of tendon sheath repair via decellularized amnion to prevent tendon adhesion,PloS one,2018 Oct 16,,"The adhesion of tendon and surrounding tissue is the most common complication after repairing an injured tendon. The injured flexor tendons in zone II are frequently accompanied by tendon sheath defects, which lead to poor recovery. A variety of biological and non-biological materials have been recently used for repair or as substitute for tendon sheaths to prevent tendon adhesion. However, non-biological materials, such as polyethylene films, have been used to prevent tendon adhesions by mechanical isolation. The possibility of tendon necrosis and permanent foreign body remains due to the lack of permeability and the obstruction of nutrient infiltration. The natural macromolecule amniotic membrane derived from organisms is a semi-permeable membrane with the following characteristics: smooth; without vascular, nerve, and lymphatic; and rich in matrix, cytokines, enzymes, and other active ingredients. The unique structure of this membrane makes it an ideal biomaterial. In the experiment in Henry chicken, the model of tendon sheath defect and the flexor digitorum tendon in zone II was established and randomly divided into control group, medical membrane group, and decellularized amniotic membrane group. Samples were obtained at the 2nd, 4th, 8th, and 12th week after operation. General, histological, and biomechanical tests were performed to investigate the preventive effect of repaired tendon sheath by decallularized amniotic membrane. Experimental results showed the following: the amniotic membrane group and the medical membrane group had mild inflammatory reaction and tissue edema, and nearly no adhesion was observed in the surrounding tissue; the fibroblast-like cells were distributed in layers under the light microscope; the amniotic membrane group was denser than the medical membrane group cells, and numerous fibroblasts were disorganized in the control group. Biomechanical measurements showed that the sliding distance of tendon, the total flexion angle of the toes, and the tendon maximum tensile breaking strength at the early postoperative were significantly better than in the control group. Through this experiment, the amniotic membrane, as a natural biological substitute material in the construction of tendon sheath, can effectively inhibit exogenous healing and promote endogenous healing to prevent tendon adhesion."
88,A Sport Fitness Index for Assessment of Sport-Related Injury Risk,Clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the Canadian Academy of Sport Medicine,2016 Sep,,"Objective:                       To develop and validate a concise survey that will identify athletes who possess elevated injury risk.                  Design:                       Cohort study.                  Setting:                       National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I athletic program.                  Participants:                       Cohorts of 188 and 146 college athletes who participated during successive academic years.                  Assessment of risk factors:                       The first cohort provided responses to 4 joint-specific outcome surveys that were related to subsequent time-loss injury occurrence. Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified survey items that provided best discrimination, which were combined with a negative life event stress item to create a new 10-item survey. The second cohort provided responses to the new survey, which were converted to a 0 to 100 score.                  Main outcome measures:                       Construct validity was assessed through documentation of time-loss injuries sustained during the preceding 12 months and predictive validity was assessed through prospective documentation of sport-related sprains and strains. Cronbach alpha was calculated to assess internal consistency.                  Results:                       Each of the outcome survey items used to develop the new survey demonstrated much greater specificity than sensitivity. Both the retrospective and prospective receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses identified scores of 96 and 88 as cut-points that provided good discrimination between injured and noninjured cases. The area under the curve was 0.69 (P < 0.001) for the retrospective analysis and 0.62 (P = 0.016) for the prospective analysis. Cronbach alpha was 0.89 (90% CI, 0.86-0.91).                  Conclusions:                       Self-reported effects of previous injury may be one method to efficiently identify athletes who possess elevated injury risk, and subsequently deliver preventive interventions, thereby providing an alternative method to time-intensive functional testing."
89,Eye injuries in the elderly from consumer products in the United States: 2001-2007,Graefe's archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology = Albrecht von Graefes Archiv fur klinische und experimentelle Ophthalmologie,2013 Mar,,"Purpose:                       To quantify and characterize eye injuries related to consumer products in elderly patients (≥ 65) treated in United States (US) hospital emergency departments (EDs) in 2001-2007.                  Design:                       Retrospective study.                  Participants:                       The study comprised 1,455 patient cases.                  Methods:                       Descriptive analysis of consumer-product (CP)-related eye injury data derived from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, a probability sample of 100 hospitals nationwide with 24-hour EDs. Narrative data was used to assign each case with the CP causing the eye injury, correcting for cases with misclassified CP codes. The proportions of eye injury visits were calculated by age, gender, diagnosis, disposition, locale of incident, and CP categories. The patient population included ocular injuries of all severity levels. We examined data for all non-fatal eye injuries in elderly patients (≥ 65) treated in US EDs in 2001-2007.                  Main outcome measures:                       Age, gender, diagnosis, case disposition, locale of incident, CP causing the injury.                  Results:                       There were an estimated 67,864 visits to United States EDs by patients >65 years for CP-related eye injuries during the study period, of which 64 % (43,105; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 40,739-45,472) were by males; 70 % (CI, 44,837-49,496) occurred at home. Chemicals (22 %; 15,236; CI, 13,482-16,989), followed by cutting tools/construction (21 %; 14,524; CI, 12,777-16,272), furniture (15 %; 10,145; CI, 8,724-11,566), and gardening (14 %; 9,467; CI, 8,021-10,912) were the most common causes of eye injury. The CP categories with the greatest proportion of preventable injuries were cutting tools/construction (90 %), gardening (88 %), and household tools (71 %). Contusions or abrasions (39 %; 26,968; CI, 24,850-29,086) were the most common diagnoses.                  Conclusions:                       This study suggests that most CP-related elderly eye injuries in the U.S. occur at home and in men. Chemicals are the most common cause of injury. Further research is needed to determine effective strategies to minimize CP-related eye injuries in the elderly."
90,Ensuring the Right to Rest: City Ordinances and Access to Rest Breaks for Workers in the Construction Industry,Journal of occupational and environmental medicine,2018 Apr,,"Objective:                       The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of city Rest Break Ordinance (RBO) policies in expanding access to rest at work.                  Methods:                       We use data from surveys of construction workers in Austin and Dallas, Texas, in 2009, 2012, and 2015 (n = 557) to calculate the odds of receiving a rest break in pre- versus post-RBO Austin and in post-RBO Austin versus pre-RBO Dallas, controlling for demographic and employment characteristics.                  Results:                       Construction workers were 35% more likely to report receiving a rest break in Austin post-RBO and 16% less likely in Dallas without a RBO as compared to Austin with a RBO.                  Conclusion:                       The increased likelihood of receiving rest breaks at work in a RBO city suggests that, in the absence of enforceable national standards, city-level RBOs can be an important first step to effective prevention of heat-related illnesses (HRIs) and heat-related fatalities at work."
91,Use of Social or Behavioral Theories in Exercise-Related Injury Prevention Program Research: A Systematic Review,"Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)",2019 Oct,,"Background:                       The use of social or behavioral theories within exercise-related injury prevention program (ERIPP) research may lead to a better understanding of why adherence to the programs is low and inform the development of interventions to improve program adherence. There is a need to determine which theories have been used within the literature and at what level theory was used to further the field.                  Objective:                       To determine which social or behavioral science theories have been incorporated within ERIPP research and assess the level at which the theories were used. The key question guiding the search was ""What social or behavioral theories have been used within ERIPP research?""                  Methods:                       A systematic review of the literature was completed with an appraisal of bias risk using a custom critical appraisal tool. An electronic search of EBSCOhost (Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, Medline, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection) and PubMed was completed from inception to October 2018. Studies investigating attitudes towards ERIPP participation with the use of a social or behavioral theoretical model or framework were eligible for inclusion.                  Results:                       The electronic search returned 7482 results and two articles were identified though a hand search, which resulted in ten articles meeting inclusion criteria. Four different behavioral or social theoretical models or frameworks were identified including the health action process approach model, health belief model, self-determination theory, and theory of planned behavior. Six studies utilized the theory at a B level meaning a theoretical construct was measured while four utilized the theory at the C level meaning the theory was tested. The mean critical appraisal score was 78%, indicating a majority of the studies were higher quality.                  Conclusion:                       There has been an increase in the use of theory within literature that is specific to ERIPP participation. Additionally, the use of theory has shifted from guiding program design to the measurement of theoretical constructs and testing of the theoretical models."
92,Climatic and psychosocial risks of heat illness incidents on construction site,Applied ergonomics,2016 Mar,,"The study presented in this paper aims to identify prominent risks leading to heat illness in summer among construction workers that can be prioritised for developing effective interventions. Samples are 216 construction workers' cases at the individual level and 26 construction projects cases at the organisation level. A grounded theory is generated to define the climatic heat and psychosocial risks and the relationships between risks, timing and effectiveness of interventions. The theoretical framework is then used to guide content analysis of 36 individual onsite heat illness cases to identify prominent risks. The results suggest that heat stress risks on construction site are socially constructed and can be effectively managed through elimination at supply chain level, effective engineering control, proactive control of the risks through individual interventions and reactive control through mindful recognition and response to early symptoms. The role of management infrastructure as a base for effective interventions is discussed."
93,Modeling and Optimization of Airbag Helmets for Preventing Head Injuries in Bicycling,Annals of biomedical engineering,2017 Apr,,"Bicycling is the leading cause of sports-related traumatic brain injury. Most of the current bike helmets are made of expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam and ultimately designed to prevent blunt trauma, e.g., skull fracture. However, these helmets have limited effectiveness in preventing brain injuries. With the availability of high-rate micro-electrical-mechanical systems sensors and high energy density batteries, a new class of helmets, i.e., expandable helmets, can sense an impending collision and expand to protect the head. By allowing softer liner medium and larger helmet sizes, this novel approach in helmet design provides the opportunity to achieve much lower acceleration levels during collision and may reduce the risk of brain injury. In this study, we first develop theoretical frameworks to investigate impact dynamics of current EPS helmets and airbag helmets-as a form of expandable helmet design. We compared our theoretical models with anthropomorphic test dummy drop test experiments. Peak accelerations obtained from these experiments with airbag helmets achieve up to an 8-fold reduction in the risk of concussion compared to standard EPS helmets. Furthermore, we construct an optimization framework for airbag helmets to minimize concussion and severe head injury risks at different impact velocities, while avoiding excessive deformation and bottoming-out. An optimized airbag helmet with 0.12 m thickness at 72 ± 8 kPa reduces the head injury criterion (HIC) value to 190 ± 25 at 6.2 m/s head impact velocity compared to a HIC of 1300 with a standard EPS helmet. Based on a correlation with previously reported HIC values in the literature, this airbag helmet design substantially reduces the risks of severe head injury up to 9 m/s."
94,Risk Engagement and Protection Survey (REPS): developing and validating a survey tool on fathers' attitudes towards child injury protection and risk engagement,Injury prevention : journal of the International Society for Child and Adolescent Injury Prevention,2018 Apr,,"Introduction:                       Fathers play a unique role in keeping children safe from injury yet understanding of their views and attitudes towards protecting children from injury and allowing them to engage in risks is limited. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate an instrument to measure fathers' attitudes towards these two constructs.                  Methods and findings:                       An instrument was developed that used prior qualitative research to inform item generation. The questions were assessed for content validity with experts, then pilot-tested with fathers. The survey was completed by 302 fathers attending hospital with their child for an injury or non-injury reason. Results of confirmatory factor analysis identified eight items relating to the protection from injury factor and six items relating to the risk engagement factor. Correlation between the two factors was low, suggesting these are two independent constructs.                  Conclusions:                       The Risk Engagement and Protection Survey offers a tool for measuring attitudes and assisting with intervention strategy development in ways that reflect fathers' views and promotes a balanced view of children's needs for safety with their needs for engaging in active, healthy risk-taking."
95,Construct validity and impact of mode of administration of the PedsQL™ among a pediatric injury population,Health and quality of life outcomes,2014 Nov 30,,"Background:                       The purpose of this study was to determine the construct validity of the PedsQL™ health related quality of life (HRQoL) instrument for use among injured children and to examine the impact of using different modes of administration, including paper and pencil, online and telephone.                  Methods:                       Two hundred thirty-three participants (aged 0 - 16) were recruited from hospital wards and the emergency department of a pediatric hospital in a large urban center in British Columbia, Canada. Data used to evaluate the construct validity of the PedsQL™ were collected from participants at the time of seeking injury treatment (baseline) to capture a retrospective measure of pre injury health, and one month post injury. Data used to compare different modes of administration (n = 44) were collected at baseline. To assess construct validity repeated measures analysis of variance (rANOVA) was used to determine whether the PedsQL™ tool was able to discriminate between patients pre and post injury while investigating possible interaction by category of length of stay in hospital. The impact of different modalities of administering the PedsQL™ on item responses was investigated using Bland-Altman plots.                  Results:                       rANOVA showed significant differences in PedsQL™ total score between baseline and one month post injury (p < .001), and differences in mean total score at one month post injury by category of injury severity (p < .001). There was also significant interaction by category of injury severity for the change in PedsQL™ total score from baseline to one month (p < .001). Pearson's correlations were highly significant across three modalities of survey administration: paper and pencil, computer and telephone administration (range: .92 to .97, p < .001). Bland-Altman plots showed strong consistency.                  Conclusion:                       The PedsQL™ instrument is able to discriminate between pre and post injury HRQoL, as well as HRQoL post injury for injuries of varying severity. These findings are an indication that this instrument has good construct validity for the purpose of evaluating HRQoL of injured children. Data collected via paper-pencil, online and telephone administration were highly consistent. This is important as depending on the setting, clinical or research, different modalities of completing this instrument may be more appropriate."
96,Formulating a programme of repairs to structural home injury hazards in New Zealand,Accident; analysis and prevention,2013 Aug,,"Home injuries are a substantial health burden worldwide, with the home setting being at least as important as the road for injury. Focusing on common injury hazards presented by the home environment, we sought to examine the justification for significant expenditure on safety-related repairs to the housing stock. Trained inspectors assessed 961 New Zealand houses for injury hazards. Using administrative data from the Accident Compensation Corporation (the national injury insurance agency), 1328 home injuries were identified amongst the 1612 occupants of these houses over the 2006-2009 period. Telephone interviews gathered data on the location and nature of these injuries, and the attitudes of those injured to potential injury hazards in their homes. Commonly occurring injury hazards that could be repaired at modest cost were identified based on their prevalence estimated by the housing inspection, and their location with respect to the areas of the home where the injuries occurred (identified during the telephone interviews). About 38% of the home injuries studied were potentially related to a structural aspect of the home environment. Common safety hazards included the lack of working smoke detectors (65% of the sample), inadequately fenced driveways (55%), hot water temperatures measured at over 60° (49%) and poorly lit access to the house (34%). A protocol for identifying and repairing important common hazards was designed. The actual safety effects of this protocol are in the process of being examined in a randomised controlled trial."
97,"Framing and blaming: construction of workplace injuries by legislators in Alberta, Canada",International journal of occupational and environmental health,2013 Oct-Dec,,"Background:                       Legislators in the Canadian province of Alberta have successfully resisted pressure to increase state injury-prevention efforts.                  Objectives:                       This study seeks to identify the narratives used by legislators to manage political pressure for increased injury-prevention efforts.                  Methods:                       Narrative analysis of legislative transcripts from 2000 to 2012.                  Results:                       Three narratives are identified in the data: (1) injuries are caused by ignorance and inattention, (2) workplaces are safe and getting safer, and (3) risk is inevitable and mitigation is (too) expensive. Each narrative has 2-4 subcomponents.                  Conclusions:                       The consistency of the messages delivered by legislators over time suggests an intentional effort to frame workplace injury in ways that manage political pressure for greater state efforts to prevent workplace injuries while maintaining the government's legitimacy. The narratives used by legislators draw on widely held beliefs about workplace injuries, including the careless worker myth and the notion that safety pays."

During the first decade of the new millennium, a consensus emerged in the UK on the need for universal access to FLS. This presentation described constructive interactions between policy makers, professional organizations, patients and their associations, and pharmaceutical manufacturers that led to the incorporation of FLS into national policy and guidance."
99,Experts' perspectives on the application of public-private partnership policy in prevention of road traffic injuries,Chinese journal of traumatology = Zhonghua chuang shang za zhi,2020 Jun,,"Purpose:                       Successful application experiences on public-private partnership (PPP) in different countries, suggest that PPP could be an option in road traffic injury (RTI) prevention. The present study aims at investigating the applicability of PPP policy in RTI prevention in Iran based on the experts' perspectives.                  Methods:                       This is a qualitative study with grounded theory approach which has been conducted in Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Iran in 2018. The participants were 22 experts in the field of RTIs selected using purposive sampling method. Data were collected by semi-structured interviews and analyzed with content-analysis method.                  Results:                       The results were classified under 5 main themes (applicability, scopes and services, challenges, advantages, and strategies) for applying PPP policy and 37 sub-themes. Due to the prevalence of RTIs, the present challenges in public sector, existence of qualified private sector, and successful experiences in other areas, there are opportunities for private sector partnership in prevention of RTIs. Private sector could participate in different scopes and services regarding RTI prevention, including road construction and maintenance, maintenance and provision of vehicles safety and public education. The main challenges including legislation issues, ambiguities in collaboration, political and organizational unsustainability, government's financial hardship and lack of experienced experts in the field of RTI. However, there are significant advantages including high efficiency in program implementation, covering the weaknesses of public sector, effective and efficient management on application of PPP in RTI prevention. The strategies include identifying and prioritizing the assignable activities, identifying the qualified private sector, developing PPP policies and legal frameworks, creating a common language between public and private parties, trying to meet the expectations of the private sector by public sector, developing a comprehensive and sound contract, and cultivating public culture to accept private sector in the field of RTI prevention.                  Conclusion:                       This study sought to determine whether PPP could be used as strategy to reduce the burden of RTIs in Iran. But it requires a lot of preliminary studies to provide the context and conditions for applying this policy."
100,Home-related injuries among under-five-year children and mothers' care regarding injury prevention in rural areas,International journal of injury control and safety promotion,2017 Sep,,"This cross-sectional study was conducted in rural areas of Twiserkan (Toyserkan) County, in Iran, to assess factors associated with home-related injuries among under-five-year children and their mothers' care regarding injury prevention. Mothers who had their under-five-year-old children injured within a 12-month period were identified from recorded information in Twiserkan Health Center. Then, data were gathered using pre-tested questionnaire and through interview with injured children's mothers. The questions were about characteristics of the children's injuries and their mothers' care regarding injury prevention, using PRECEDE (Predisposing, Reinforcing, and Enabling Constructs in Educational/Environmental Diagnosis and Evaluation) model with focus on knowledge and attitude; enabling and reinforcing factors; and mothers' preventive behaviours. The study results showed that 197 out of 210 total identified mothers took part in the study. The reported injuries were 11.68%, 39.09%, and 49.24%, respectively, for severe, moderate, and mild cases. Fall was the most frequent injury with 35%. Among PRECEDE model constructs, there was a statistically significant correlation between mothers' knowledge and injury severity among children. Home-related injuries are an important health problem among study population and their prediction and prevention are necessary. Enhancement of mothers' knowledge can be helpful to improve child injury prevention."
