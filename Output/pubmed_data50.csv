1,Effect of STOP technique on safety climate in a construction company,Journal of research in health sciences,"Background:                       Safety programs are a core part of safety management in workplaces that can reduce incidents and injuries. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of Safety Training Observation Program (STOP) technique as a behavior modification program on safety climate in a construction company.                  Methods:                       This cross-sectional study was carried out on workers of the Petrochemical Construction Company, western Iran. In order to improve safety climate, an unsafe behavior modification program entitled STOP was launched among workers of project during 12 months from April 2013 and April 2014. The STOP technique effectiveness in creating a positive safety climate was evaluated using the Safety Climate Assessment Toolkit.                  Results:                       76.78% of total behaviors were unsafe. 54.76% of total unsafe acts/ at-risk behaviors were related to the fall hazard. The most cause of unsafe behaviors was associated with habit and unavailability of safety equipment. After 12 month of continuous implementation the STOP technique, 55.8% of unsafe behaviors reduced among workers. The average score of safety climate evaluated using of the Toolkit, before and after the implementation of the STOP technique was 5.77 and 7.24, respectively.                  Conclusions:                       The STOP technique can be considered as effective approach for eliminating at-risk behavior, reinforcing safe work practices, and creating a positive safety climate in order to reduction incidents/injuries."
2,Safety and ergonomic considerations for an aging workforce in the US construction industry,"Work (Reading, Mass.)","The US construction workforce is aging as millions of baby boomers move toward retirement age. Older workers make a substantial contribution to construction in terms of skills and experience. However, construction is still one of the most physically demanding occupations, hence the health implications for older workers. Descriptions of injuries, illnesses and fatalities among older workers in the US construction industry from recent literature are presented along with the practical health and safety interventions that have been proposed including: ergonomic interventions, wellness programs, worksite housekeeping, training, and safety climate. Understanding the risks and hazards in specific industries could help identify training and intervention requirements to meet the challenges facing aging workers in these occupational groups."
3,A multi-agent safety response model in the construction industry,"Work (Reading, Mass.)","Background:                       The construction industry is one of the sectors with the highest accident rates and the most serious accidents. A multi-agent safety response approach allows a useful diagnostic tool in order to understand factors affecting risk and accidents. The special features of the construction sector can influence the relationships among safety responses along the model of safety influences.                  Objective:                       The purpose of this paper is to test a model explaining risk and work-related accidents in the construction industry as a result of the safety responses of the organization, the supervisors, the co-workers and the worker.                  Sample:                       374 construction employees belonging to 64 small Spanish construction companies working for two main companies participated in the study.                  Instruments:                       Safety responses were measured using a 45-item Likert-type questionnaire.                  Methodology:                       The structure of the measure was analyzed using factor analysis and the model of effects was tested using a structural equation model.                  Results:                       Factor analysis clearly identifies the multi-agent safety dimensions hypothesized. The proposed safety response model of work-related accidents, involving construction specific results, showed a good fit.                  Conclusions:                       The multi-agent safety response approach to safety climate is a useful framework for the assessment of organizational and behavioral risks in construction."
4,Engaging Occupational Safety and Health Professionals in Bridging Research and Practice: Evaluation of a Participatory Workshop Program in the Danish Construction Industry,International journal of environmental research and public health,"Engaging occupational safety and health (OSH) professionals has scarcely been evaluated as a means for transferring knowledge to practice about physical workload in the construction industry. The aim of this work was to examine how participants used and incorporate research-based knowledge from a three-day training course into practice. Twenty OSH professionals from the Danish construction industry participated in a workshop-training course. Researchers presented new knowledge and results about physically demanding work. The participants selected which themes they wanted to work with and developed an action plan. Evaluation was done using surveys and phone interviews. Analysis was based on how the OSH-professionals describe themselves, organizations, and the construction industry. Participant's average scores on the level of implementation of their chosen action plans were 3 (on a response scale from 1-5, where 1 is 'to a very low degree' and 5 is 'to a very high degree') immediately after the workshop program and 2.5 at follow-up. Qualitative evaluations showed that actions had been initiated, and some progress had been made. The participants were satisfied with the workshop course and the possibility to increase their knowledge through inputs from researchers and colleges and strongly believe that they would succeed with implementing their action plans in the future."
5,"Prevalence, source and severity of work-related injuries among ""foreign"" construction workers in a large Malaysian organisation: a cross-sectional study",Industrial health,"Malaysian construction sector is regarded as critical in the field of health because of the high rates of accidents and fatalities. This research aimed to determine the prevalence, sources and severity of injuries and its association with commitment to safety among foreign construction workers. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 323 foreign construction workers from six construction projects of a large organization in Malaysia, using a simple random sampling method. Data was collected using a structured questionnaire to assess work-related injuries and safety commitment. The collected data was analysed by SPSS 22.0 using descriptive statistics and Ï‡2 test. The prevalence of work-related injuries in a one year period was 22.6%, where most of the injuries were of moderate severity (39.7%) and falls from heights represented the main source (31.5%). The majority of the foreign construction workers had perceived between moderate and high safety commitment, which was significantly associated with work-related injuries. The results also showed a significant association of work-related injuries with the company's interest in Safety and Health, Safety and Health training, and safety equipment. Thus, the implementation of new procedures and providing relevant trainings and safety equipment; will lead to a decrease in injury rates in construction sites."
6,Organizational culture and a safety-conscious work environment: The mediating role of employee communication satisfaction,Journal of safety research,"Introduction:                       A safety-conscious work environment allows high-reliability organizations to be proactive regarding safety and enables employees to feel free to report any concern without fear of retaliation. Currently, research on the antecedents to safety-conscious work environments is scarce.                  Method:                       Structural equation modeling was applied to test the mediating role of employee communication satisfaction in the relationship between constructive culture and a safety-conscious work environment in several nuclear power plants.                  Results:                       Employee communication satisfaction partially mediated the positive relationships between a constructive culture and a safety-conscious work environment.                  Conclusions:                       Constructive cultures in which cooperation, supportive relationships, individual growth and high performance are encouraged facilitate the establishment of a safety-conscious work environment. This influence is partially explained by increased employee communication satisfaction.                  Practical application:                       Constructive cultures should be encouraged within organizations. In addition, managers should promote communication policies and practices that support a safety-conscious work environment."
7,Individual safety performance in the construction industry: development and validation of two short scales,Accident; analysis and prevention,"In the current research a short measure of safety performance is developed for use in the construction industry and the relationships between different components of safety performance and safety outcomes (e.g., occupational injuries and work-related pain) are explored within the construction context. This research consists of two field studies. In the first, comprehensive measures of safety compliance and safety participation were shortened and modified to be appropriate for use in construction. Evidence of reliability and validity is provided. Both safety compliance and safety participation were negatively related to occupational injuries, yet these two correlations were not statistically different. In the second study, we investigated the relationships between these two components of safety performance and work-related pain frequency, in addition to replicating Study 1. Safety compliance had a stronger negative relationship with pain than safety participation. Implications for research are discussed."
8,"Long workhours, work scheduling and work-related injuries among construction workers in the United States","Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health","Objectives:                       The objectives of this study were (i) to examine work scheduling in construction and (ii) to establish whether there is any connection between workhours and safety outcomes among construction workers.                  Methods:                       The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979 cohort (NLSY79), was used for the data analysis. Odds ratios were used to measure the risk of work-related injury in different worker groups.                  Results:                       The findings showed that (i) construction workers started work earlier, worked longer days and fewer weeks a year, and were more likely to hold multiple jobs and change jobs than their nonconstruction counterparts and (ii) long workhours and irregular work schedules were significantly associated with a higher work-related injury rate after control for possible confounders.                  Conclusion:                       The results provide evidence that overtime and irregular work scheduling have an adverse effect on worker safety."
9,"The safety climate and its relationship to safety practices, safety of the work environment and occupational accidents in eight wood-processing companies",Accident; analysis and prevention,"Employees continuously observe their work environment and the actions of their fellow workers and superiors, and they use such observations as a basis for the creation of cognitive models associated with safety. These models regulate their actions in the workplace and thus have an influence on safety. This study attempts to define the structure of the safety climate as perceived by workers and the correlations between the safety climate, on the one hand, and the safety practices of the company, the safety level of the work environment and occupational accidents on the other. The variables used in this study were the same as those employed in two previous Finnish safety climate studies carried out in the plywood industry, shipyards, the forestry industry, building construction and stevedoring. The safety climate was measured by means of a questionnaire. Workers from four sawmills, two plywood factories and two parquet plants participated. The total number of participants was 508 in 1990 and 548 in 1993. The variables formed four factors, whose contents and reliabilities closely resembled the results obtained in the earlier studies. These results indicate that the structure of the safety climate among Finnish workers is quite stable. The safety climate correlated both with the safety level of the work environment and with the safety practices of the company, but the correlation between the safety climate and the safety of the work environment was stronger. This result differs from those of the previous studies, in which the safety climate was defined specifically in terms of an individual's perceptions of the safety practices of the company and of the behavior of other employees. The two safety climate factors that described a company's attitudes to safety and its safety precautions correlated with the accident rates. The better the safety climate of the company was, the lower was the accident rate. Four companies with an accident rate below the average for the wood-processing industry had a better safety climate than four similar companies with an accident rate above the average."
10,Modeling the Relationship between Safety Climate and Safety Performance in a Developing Construction Industry: A Cross-Cultural Validation Study,International journal of environmental research and public health,"This study attempts to validate a safety performance (SP) measurement model in the cross-cultural setting of a developing country. In addition, it highlights the variations in investigating the relationship between safety climate (SC) factors and SP indicators. The data were collected from forty under-construction multi-storey building projects in Pakistan. Based on the results of exploratory factor analysis, a SP measurement model was hypothesized. It was tested and validated by conducting confirmatory factor analysis on calibration and validation sub-samples respectively. The study confirmed the significant positive impact of SC on safety compliance and safety participation, and negative impact on number of self-reported accidents/injuries. However, number of near-misses could not be retained in the final SP model because it attained a lower standardized path coefficient value. Moreover, instead of safety participation, safety compliance established a stronger impact on SP. The study uncovered safety enforcement and promotion as a novel SC factor, whereas safety rules and work practices was identified as the most neglected factor. The study contributed to the body of knowledge by unveiling the deviations in existing dimensions of SC and SP. The refined model is expected to concisely measure the SP in the Pakistani construction industry, however, caution must be exercised while generalizing the study results to other developing countries."
11,"""To have and then lose the safety net"" - Female cancer survivors' experiences of the process of becoming ready to return to work","Work (Reading, Mass.)","Background:                       Validation studies have not been able to confirm the stage-specific understanding as operationalised in the readiness for return to work (RRTW) questionnaire.                  Objective:                       To explore retrospectively how working female cancer survivors experienced the process of becoming ready to RTW during and beyond participation in an occupational rehabilitation intervention and thereby expand the understanding of the RRTW construct.                  Methods:                       A qualitative research design was employed. Thirteen female cancer survivors were included for semi-structured interviews one to two years after they had completed active treatment and returned to work. The RRTW construct guided data generation and analysis. Content analysis was performed in four analytical steps that combined a concept-driven and a data-driven analytic strategy.                  Results:                       Three themes were identified; ""To have and then lose the safety net"", ""Realise a changed life situation"", ""Strive to balance work and everyday life"". In a time span of approximately one to two years (from receiving treatment, being enrolled in an intervention and to gradually returning to work); the identified themes were interdependent of each other as one theme gradually evolved to the next theme in the process of engaging in sustained work participation.                  Conclusions:                       The present study points towards continuous development of the RRTW construct and whether the addition of a preparedness dimension would improve validity."
12,Is there agreement between worker self and supervisor assessment of worker safety performance? An examination in the construction industry,Journal of safety research,"Introduction:                       Individual safety performance (behavior) critically influences safety outcomes in high-risk workplaces. Compared to the study of generic work performance on different measurements, few studies have investigated different measurements of safety performance, typically relying on employees' self-reflection of their safety behavior. This research aims to address this limitation by including worker self-reflection and other (i.e., supervisor) assessment of two worker safety performance dimensions, safety compliance and safety participation.                  Method:                       A sample of 105 workers and 17 supervisors in 17 groups in the Chinese construction industry participated in this study. Comparisons were made between worker compliance and participation in each measurement, and between workers' and supervisors' assessment of workers' compliance and participation. Multilevel modeling was adopted to test the moderating effects on the worker self-reflection and supervisor-assessment relationship by group safety climate and the work experience of supervisors.                  Results:                       Higher levels of safety compliance than participation were found for self-reflection and supervisor assessment. The discrepancy between the two measurements in each safety performance dimension was significant. The work experience of supervisors attenuated the discrepancy between self- and supervisor-assessment of compliance. Contrary to our expectations, the moderating effect of group safety climate was not supported.                  Conclusions:                       The discrepancy between worker self- and supervisor-assessment of worker safety performance, thus, suggests the importance of including alternative measurements of safety performance in addition to self-reflection. Lower levels of participation behavior in both raters suggest more research on the motivators of participatory behavior. Practical applications The discrepancy between different raters can lead to negative reactions of ratees, suggesting that managers should be aware of that difference. Assigning experienced supervisors as raters can be effective at mitigating interrater discrepancy and conflicts in the assessment of compliance behavior."
13,Beyond ConCA: Rethinking causality and construction accidents,Applied ergonomics,"The construction industry takes an orthodox approach to safety: Finding root causes, quantifying risk, and often blaming frontline workers. However, safety has reached a plateau and the limitations of this approach are starting to be acknowledged. A sociotechnical systems approach (as applied in the ConCA model) presents new opportunities to understand accident causation by linking immediate accident circumstances with the distal shaping and originating influences. 32 construction safety managers, consultants, and experts contributed their views regarding the hazards of construction (both human and physical) and the difficulties managing these. The findings provide an insight into the work of construction safety managers and their decision making which is influenced by industry-wide pressures and worker attributes over physical hazards. Construction suffers from a wide range of pressures; a combination of both top-down, from the client, and bottom-up challenges from the workforce it attracts. The original ConCA model has been revised to reflect the findings. By applying systems thinking, the relationships between negative perceptions of workers' risk-taking and these challenges can be crystallised. The results support integrating safety into primary activities to increase engagement, learning legacies to transfer knowledge between projects, multi-disciplinary teams to raise risk awareness, empowerment to combat their feelings of dissatisfaction and disloyalty, and collaboration in risk management to incorporate workers' expertise and ensure they feel valued."
14,"The associations between work-life balance behaviours, teamwork climate and safety climate: cross-sectional survey introducing the work-life climate scale, psychometric properties, benchmarking data and future directions",BMJ quality & safety,"Background:                       Improving the resiliency of healthcare workers is a national imperative, driven in part by healthcare workers having minimal exposure to the skills and culture to achieve work-life balance (WLB). Regardless of current policies, healthcare workers feel compelled to work more and take less time to recover from work. Satisfaction with WLB has been measured, as has work-life conflict, but how frequently healthcare workers engage in specific WLB behaviours is rarely assessed. Measurement of behaviours may have advantages over measurement of perceptions; behaviours more accurately reflect WLB and can be targeted by leaders for improvement.                  Objectives:                       1. To describe a novel survey scale for evaluating work-life climate based on specific behavioural frequencies in healthcare workers.2. To evaluate the scale's psychometric properties and provide benchmarking data from a large healthcare system.3. To investigate associations between work-life climate, teamwork climate and safety climate.                  Methods:                       Cross-sectional survey study of US healthcare workers within a large healthcare system.                  Results:                       7923 of 9199 eligible healthcare workers across 325 work settings within 16 hospitals completed the survey in 2009 (86% response rate). The overall work-life climate scale internal consistency was Cronbach Î±=0.790. t-Tests of top versus bottom quartile work settings revealed that positive work-life climate was associated with better teamwork climate, safety climate and increased participation in safety leadership WalkRounds with feedback (p<0.001). Univariate analysis of variance demonstrated differences that varied significantly in WLB between healthcare worker role, hospitals and work setting.                  Conclusions:                       The work-life climate scale exhibits strong psychometric properties, elicits results that vary widely by work setting, discriminates between positive and negative workplace norms, and aligns well with other culture constructs that have been found to correlate with clinical outcomes."
15,Linking Challenge-Hindrance Stressors to Safety Outcomes and Performance: A Dual Mediation Model for Construction Workers,International journal of environmental research and public health,"Occupational stressors have long been recognized as an important risk factor for injury accidents. The mechanisms underlying the relationships among challenge stressors, hindrance stressors, safety outcomes (occupational injuries), emotional experiences (attentiveness), and job performance (task performance) were investigated from the perspectives of the challenge-hindrance stress model and the conservation of resources theory. This study collected multi-source data over two timepoints for 105 safety supervisors and 379 construction workers in China. Results revealed that both challenge and hindrance stressors were positively related to occupational injuries, but only challenge stressors were positively associated with attentiveness. In addition, occupational injuries mediated the relationship between both challenge and hindrance stressors and task performance, while attentiveness mediated only the relationship between challenge stressors and task performance. These findings contribute to our knowledge of stress management in the construction project context and provide recommendations for stress management for front-line workers at construction sites."
16,"Protecting Construction Worker Health and Safety in Ontario, Canada: Identifying a Union Safety Effect",Journal of occupational and environmental medicine,"Objectives:                       Do Ontario unionized construction firms have lower workers' compensation claims rates compared with nonunion firms?                  Methods:                       Building trade and construction trade association lists of union contractors were linked to Workplace Safety and Insurance Board claims data for 2006 to 2012. Data were pooled for 2006 to 2012, and negative binomial regressions conducted with adjustment to estimate a union safety effect.                  Results:                       The sample included 5797 unionized and 38,626 nonunion construction firms. Total claims rates were 13% higher (1.13, 1.09 to 1.18) in unionized firms because of higher allowed no-lost-time claim rates (1.28, 1.23 to 1.34), whereas the lost-time claims rate was 14% lower (0.86, 0.82 to 0.91).                  Conclusions:                       Unionized construction firms compared with nonunion firms have higher no-lost-time and lower lost-time claims rates. Unionized firms may encourage occupational injury reporting and reduce risks through training and hazard identification and control strategies."
17,Safety early warning research for highway construction based on case-based reasoning and variable fuzzy sets,TheScientificWorldJournal,"As a high-risk subindustry involved in construction projects, highway construction safety has experienced major developments in the past 20 years, mainly due to the lack of safe early warnings in Chinese construction projects. By combining the current state of early warning technology with the requirements of the State Administration of Work Safety and using case-based reasoning (CBR), this paper expounds on the concept and flow of highway construction safety early warnings based on CBR. The present study provides solutions to three key issues, index selection, accident cause association analysis, and warning degree forecasting implementation, through the use of association rule mining, support vector machine classifiers, and variable fuzzy qualitative and quantitative change criterion modes, which fully cover the needs of safe early warning systems. Using a detailed description of the principles and advantages of each method and by proving the methods' effectiveness and ability to act together in safe early warning applications, effective means and intelligent technology for a safe highway construction early warning system are established."
18,Degrees of connectivity: Systems model for upstream risk assessment and mitigation,Accident; analysis and prevention,"There is growing recognition that in order to further improve safety performance, attention needs to be given beyond the immediate working conditions and worker actions. A systems approach to construction safety enables considering: multiple project elements simultaneously; connections between different elements; and all system elements affected by safety risk. This paper describes recent and current research to conceptualize a typical building project in terms of connections between workers, activities, and design elements, and to verify and analyze impacts of the design and worker interactions on worker safety. Prior research provides the basis for a network tying the design elements, construction activities, and work crews on a typical building project together along with the extent of interaction between each of the system elements in terms of safety. In conjunction with this systems approach, the researchers propose a concept for viewing and managing construction safety through four different types of connections, or ""degrees of connectivity,"" between the different workers, activities, and design elements in the system. The degrees of connectivity are defined as: interacting with the design element during its construction (DoC #1); interacting with the design element in its final form to attach another component to it (DoC #2) or by working in the vicinity of it (DoC #3); and indirectly interacting with the design element through another worker (DoC #4). To support and verify the presence of the concept in practice, the researchers conducted a survey of construction personnel. The survey results confirm that the four different degrees of connectivity are present and felt during construction operations, and indicate that attention should be given to all design elements, activities, and workers to which a worker is ""connected"". According to the survey respondents, DoC's #1 and #2 are recognized as the most widely present on construction sites. Eighty percent of the respondents believe that the design element has a moderate or greater impact on worker safety while it is being constructed. These initial research steps provide the starting point for continuing study that aims to develop and demonstrate the degrees of connectivity concept linking workers and design elements, with the goal of understanding how to design a project and work operations in order to improve safety during construction."
19,Young worker safety in construction: do family ties and workgroup size affect hazard exposures and safety practices?,"Work (Reading, Mass.)","Objective:                       Little is known about how social aspects of the work environment influence exposures or safety practices affecting young construction workers. Our objective was to investigate whether working on a construction site with a small number of workers (â‰¤10 vs. 11-50) or having a family-firm connection (working in a family-owned firm or one in which a family member also works) impacts hazard exposures and safety practices.                  Participants:                       Participants included 187 North Carolina construction workers 14 to 17 years old who were surveyed about their jobs.                  Methods:                       We conducted stratified analyses using cross-tabulations and chi-square statistics to measure associations between workgroup size (i.e., the total number of workers on a jobsite) and family-firm connections (yes/no) and hazard exposures (e.g., saws) and safety practices (e.g., supervision).                  Results:                       Having a family-firm connection was associated with fewer hazard exposures and greater safety practices. Youth who worked on jobsites with a larger workgroup (11-50 workers) reported more hazards but also more safety practices.                  Conclusions:                       Family-firm connections, in particular, may have a protective effect for youth in construction. Even though the statistical significance of our findings on workgroup size was limited in places, the pattern of differences found suggest that further research in this area is warranted."
20,Participatory Training to Improve Safety and Health in Small Construction Sites in Some Countries in Asia: Development and Application of the WISCON Training Program,New solutions : a journal of environmental and occupational health policy : NS,"A participatory training program, Work Improvement in Small Construction Sites, was developed to provide practical support measures to the small construction sector. Managers and workers from selected small sites were interviewed about their occupational safety and health risks. The Work Improvement in Small Construction Sites training program comprised a 45-item action checklist, photos, and illustrations showing local examples and group work methods. Pilot training workshops were carried out with workers and employers in Cambodia, Laos, Mongolia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Participants subsequently planned, and using locally available low-cost materials, implemented their own improvements such as hand-made hand trucks to carry heavy materials, removal of projecting nails from timber materials, and fences to protect roof workers from falling. Local Work Improvement in Small Construction Sites trainers consisting of government officials, workers, employers, and nongovernment organization representatives were then trained to implement the Work Improvement in Small Construction Sites training widely. Keys to success were easy-to-apply training tools aiming at immediate, low-cost improvements, and collaboration with various local people's networks."
21,Smart Glasses-Based Personnel Proximity Warning System for Improving Pedestrian Safety in Construction and Mining Sites,International journal of environmental research and public health,"A smart glasses-based wearable personnel proximity warning system (PWS) was developed for pedestrian safety in construction and mining sites. The smart glasses receive signals transmitted by Bluetooth beacons attached to heavy equipment or vehicles, with the proximity determined by the signal strength. A visual alert is displayed to the wearer when in close proximity. The media access control address of the Bluetooth beacon provides information on the approaching equipment or vehicle, which is displayed to the wearer so that they can respond appropriately. There was a detection distance of at least 10 m regardless of the direction the pedestrian was looking and the alert was successful in all 40 trials at â‰¥10 meters. The subjective workload was evaluated using the NASA task load index on ten subjects, either without a personal PWS, with a smartphone-based PWS, or with the smart glasses-based PWS. The mental, temporal, and physical stresses were lowest when using the smart glasses-based PWS. Smart glasses-based PWSs can improve work efficiency by freeing both hands of the pedestrians, and various functions can be supported through application development. Therefore, they are particularly useful for pedestrian safety in construction and mining sites."
22,What does safety commitment mean to leaders? A multi-method investigation,Journal of safety research,"Introduction:                       Perceived management safety commitment as an aspect of safety climate or culture is a key influence on safety outcomes in organizations. What is unclear is how perceptions of management commitment are created by leaders.                  Method:                       To address this gap in the literature, we position safety commitment as a leadership construct viewed from the perspectives of the leaders who experience and demonstrate it. In this paper, an established multidimensional commitment framework is applied to leaders' safety commitment (consisting of affective, normative, and calculative commitment). Via an exploratory sequential mixed methods design combining interviews (n = 40) and surveys (n = 89), we investigate the applicability of this theoretical conceptualization to safety commitment.                  Results:                       The results indicate the multiple dimensions captured leaders' safety commitment well, safety commitment can be demonstrated via a range of behaviors, and the dimensions' association with behavioral demonstrations aligned with those of other types of commitment reported in the literature. Only affective safety commitment was consistently associated with demonstrations of safety commitment. The link between high levels of affective and normative safety commitment and demonstrations was more pronounced when participants perceived their company's safety climate more positively.                  Conclusions:                       Adopting a focus on leaders' experience of safety commitment offers opportunities for new research into the way in which safety commitment perceptions are shaped by leaders. Practical application: The findings can support leaders' reflection about their personal mindset around safety and support them in fostering strong safety climates and cultures. It further encourages organizations in creating work environments that in particular foster affective and normative safety commitments in leaders."
23,"Practical Judgment of Workload Based on Physical Activity, Work Conditions, and Worker's Age in Construction Site","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)","It is important for construction companies to sustain a productive workforce without sacrificing its health and safety. This study aims to develop a practical judgement method to estimate the workload risk of individual construction workers. Based on studies, we developed a workload model comprising a hygrothermal environment, behavioral information, and the physical characteristics of workers). The construction workers' heart rate and physical activity were measured using the data collected from a wearable device equipped with a biosensor and an acceleration sensor. This study is the first report to use worker physical activity, age, and the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) to determine a worker's physical workload. The accuracy of this health risk judgment result was 89.2%, indicating that it is possible to easily judge the health risk of workers even in an environment where it is difficult to measure the subject in advance. The proposed model and its findings can aid in monitoring the health impacts of working conditions during construction activities, and thereby contribute toward determining workers' health damage. However, the sampled construction workers are 12 workers, further studies in other working conditions are required to accumulate more evidence and assure the accuracy of the models."
24,A study of the shift in fatal construction work-related accidents during 2012-2019 in Turkey,International journal of occupational safety and ergonomics : JOSE,"Objectives. The construction sector is one of the sectors with the highest number of occupational accidents and diseases in the world in terms of working conditions. According to the 'CommuniquÃ© on Occupational Hazard Classes on Occupational Health and Safety' related to Occupational Health and Safety Law No. 6331, the construction sector is considered a 'very dangerous works' class. Methods. Occupational accidents that occurred between 2012 and 2019 are examined according to occupational groups, working environments, etc. Feature importance and Kendall, Pearson and Spearman correlations were used for analysis. Results. From the studies, it is determined that fatal accidents in the construction sector in Turkey are caused by falling from height with a high rate. When the correlation values were examined, it was determined that the column 'accident type' had a negative relationship with the 'injured part of the body' and a positive relationship with the 'accident environment' column. Conclusion. A total 51% of 3517 fatal accidents examined occurred in the construction of buildings. Most deaths in the construction sector in Turkey are caused by falling from height, like many countries (41.6%). Statistics shows that despite the relevant regulations, the construction sector in Turkey is seen as a weak safety culture."
25,Accident factors per construction type and stage: a synthesis of scientific research and professional experience,International journal of injury control and safety promotion,"Following manufacturing, construction is the industry that is responsible for the majority of work-related accidents due to the complexity and uniqueness of each construction site. The accidents that occur on construction sites reflect the safety culture and the general health and safety (H&S) policy in the construction field. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the frequency of accidents and their contributing factors in each stage of 9 different types of construction. This paper utilizes data from published scientific literature to extract the universal contributing factors to be evaluated in the Greek construction industry and to compare results with documented international accidents. The riskiest construction stages per construction type and the main factors behind them are determined. The results show contradictions regarding the contributing factors as perceived by Greek professionals and those verified by international real accident data."
26,Construction managers' perceptions of construction safety practices in small and large firms: a qualitative investigation,"Work (Reading, Mass.)","Background and goals:                       Despite the institution of explicit safety practices in construction, there continue to be exceedingly high rates of morbidity and mortality from work-related injury. This study's purpose was to identify, compare and contrast views of construction managers from large and small firms regarding construction safety practices. A complementary analysis was conducted with construction workers.                  Methods:                       A semi-structured interview guide was used to elicit information from construction managers (n = 22) in a series of focus groups. Questions were designed to obtain information on direct safety practices and indirect practices such as communication style, attitude, expectations, and unspoken messages. Data were analyzed using thematic content analysis.                  Results:                       Managers identified a broad commitment to safety, worker training, a changing workplace culture, and uniform enforcement as key constructs in maintaining safe worksites. Findings indicate that successful managers need to be involved, principled, flexible, and innovative. Best practices, as well as unsuccessful injury prevention programs, were discussed in detail. Obstacles to consistent safety practice include poor training, production schedules and financial constraints.                  Conclusions:                       Construction managers play a pivotal role in the definition and implementation of safety practices in the workplace. In order to succeed in this role, they require a wide variety of management skills, upper management support, and tools that will help them instill and maintain a positive safety culture. Developing and expanding management skills of construction managers may assist them in dealing with the complexity of the construction work environment, as well as providing them with the tools necessary to decrease work-related injuries."
27,A qualitative study of what care workers do to provide patient safety at home through telecare,BMC health services research,"Background:                       In health care, the work of keeping the patient safe and reducing the risk of harm is defined as safety work. In our digitised and technology-rich era, safety work usually involves a relationship between people and technologies. Telecare is one of the fastest-growing technology-domains in western health care systems. In the marketing of telecare, the expectation is that safety is implicit simply by the presence of technology in patients' homes. Whilst both researchers and health authorities are concerned with developing cost-benefit analyses and measuring effects, there is a lack of attention to the daily work needed to ensure that technologies contribute to patient safety. This paper aims to describe how patient safety in home care is addressed through and with telecare. We base our exploration on the social alarm, an established technology that care workers are expected to handle as an integrated part of their ordinary work.                  Methods:                       The study has a qualitative explorative design where we draw on empirical data from three case studies, involving five Norwegian municipalities that use social alarm systems in home care services. We analyse observations of practice and interviews with the actors involved, following King's outline of template analysis.                  Results:                       We identified three co-existing work processes that contributed to patient safety: ""Aligning people and technologies""; ""Being alert and staying calm""; and ""Coordinating activities based on people and technology"". Attention to these work processes exposes safety practices, and how safety is constructed in relational practices involving multiple people and technologies.                  Conclusions:                       We conclude that the three work processes identified are essential if the safety alarm is to function for the end user's safety. The safety of home-dwelling patients is reliant on the person-technology interface. The efforts of care workers and their interface with technology are a central feature of creating safety in a patient's home, and in doing so, they utilise a repertoire of skills and knowledge."
28,A review of models relevant to road safety,Accident; analysis and prevention,"It is estimated that more than 1.2 million people die worldwide as a result of road traffic crashes and some 50 million are injured per annum. At present some Western countries' road safety strategies and countermeasures claim to have developed into 'Safe Systems' models to address the effects of road related crashes. Well-constructed models encourage effective strategies to improve road safety. This review aimed to identify and summarise concise descriptions, or 'models' of safety. The review covers information from a wide variety of fields and contexts including transport, occupational safety, food industry, education, construction and health. The information from 2620 candidate references were selected and summarised in 121 examples of different types of model and contents. The language of safety models and systems was found to be inconsistent. Each model provided additional information regarding style, purpose, complexity and diversity. In total, seven types of models were identified. The categorisation of models was done on a high level with a variation of details in each group and without a complete, simple and rational description. The models identified in this review are likely to be adaptable to road safety and some of them have previously been used. None of systems theory, safety management systems, the risk management approach, or safety culture was commonly or thoroughly applied to road safety. It is concluded that these approaches have the potential to reduce road trauma."
29,Protocol for a mixed-methods study on leader-based interventions in construction contractors' safety commitments,Injury prevention : journal of the International Society for Child and Adolescent Injury Prevention,"Background:                       Owing to high injury rates, safety interventions are needed in the construction industry. Evidence-based interventions tailored to this industry are, however, scarce. Leader-based safety interventions have proven more effective than worker-based interventions in other industries.                  Objective:                       To test a leader-based safety intervention for construction sites. The intervention consists of encouraging safety coordinators to provide feedback on work safety to the client and line management. The intention is to increase communication and interactions regarding safety within the line management and between the client and the senior management. It is hypothesised that this, in turn, will lead to increased communication and interaction about safety between management and coworkers as well as an increased on-site safety level.                  Setting:                       A group-randomised double-blinded case study of six Danish construction sites (three intervention sites and three control sites). The recruitment of the construction sites is performed continuously from January 2010 to June 2010. The investigation of each site lasts 20 continuous weeks.                  Methods:                       Confirmatory statistical analysis is used to test if the safety level increased, and if the probability of safety communications between management and coworkers increases as a consequence of the intervention. The data collection will be blinded. Qualitative methods are used to evaluate if communication and interactions about safety at all managerial levels, including the client, increase.                  Outcome measures:                       (1) The proportion of safety-related communications out of all studied communications between management and coworkers. (2) The safety level index of the construction sites."
30,Constraints of coal mining safety management efficiency,"Work (Reading, Mass.)","Background:                       Investigation of the safety management efficiency in a coal mine aims to improve its safety management level thus ensuring coal mining safety. However, the safety management efficiency is affected by many factors especially for those coal mines operated underground. Furthermore, the constraint factors that are difficult to be identified and eliminated may impede safety management efficiency.                  Objective:                       This work aims to explore the constraints affecting safety management efficiency through a mathematical model accompanied by some effective measures guided by the theory of constraint (TOC).                  Methods:                       An index system for coal mining safety management efficiency (CMSME) is first established. Then a mathematical model roughly identifying the constraint factors is constructed. The principle of the proposed model is a comparison with the changes of the ratio of integrated CMSME and the ratio of each impact factor over a certain period. Thus, a constraint factor may be one whose ratio changes at a slower rate than that of the integrated CMSME. Following this, some measures are adopted to identify one, or more, real constraints. Finally, the constraints may be broken by internal, or external, means.                  Results:                       A case study from Quandian coal mine verified the proposed method: the constraints affecting CMSME could be identified and broken through during the production. This research currently is applied to coal mining activities in a few coal mines, and it will be widely used in the future.                  Conclusions:                       This paper provides a novel method investigating the constraints affecting CMSME and breaking through them. The case study shows that breaking through constraints during the production is beneficial to CMSME. Furthermore, a coal mine with a high CMSME index may still, at some time, have one, or more, bottleneck constraints."
31,Strategies to reduce safety violations for working from heights in construction companies: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,BMC public health,"Background:                       Safety measures should be applied to reduce work-related fatal and non-fatal fall injuries. However, according to the labor inspectorate, more than 80% of Dutch construction sites violate safety regulations for working from heights. To increase compliance with safety regulations, employers and workers have to select, implement and monitor safety measures. To facilitate this behavioral change, stimulating knowledge awareness and personalized feedback are frequently advocated behavior change techniques. For this study, two behavior change strategies have been developed in addition to the announcement of safety inspections by the labor inspectorate. These strategies consist of 1) face-to-face contacts with safety consultants and 2) direct mail with access to internet facilities. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of these two strategies on the safety violations for working from heights, the process and the cost measures.                  Methods/design:                       This study is a block randomized intervention trial in 27 cities to establish the effects of the face-to-face guidance strategy (N = 9), a direct mailing strategy (N = 9) and a control condition of no guidance (N = 9) on safety violations to record by labor inspectors after three months. A process evaluation for both strategies will be performed to determine program implementation (reach, dose delivered and dose received), satisfaction, knowledge and perceived safety behavior. A cost analysis will be performed to establish the financial costs for both strategies. The present study is in accordance with the CONSORT statement.                  Discussion:                       This study increases insight into performing practice-based randomized controlled trials. The outcome will help to evaluate the effect of two guidance strategies on safety violations. If these strategies are effective, implementation of these strategies through the national institute of safety and health or labor inspectorate can take place to guide construction companies in complying with safety regulations.                  Trial registration:                       NTR 4298 on 29-nov-2013."
32,Fatal accidents in nighttime vs. daytime highway construction work zones,Journal of safety research,"Introduction:                       Awareness about worker safety in nighttime construction has been a major concern because it is believed that nighttime construction creates hazardous work conditions. However, only a few studies provide valuable comparative information about accident characteristics of nighttime and daytime highway construction activities.                  Method:                       This study investigates fatal accidents that occurred in Illinois highway work zones in the period 1996-2001 in order to determine the safety differences between nighttime and daytime highway construction. The lighting and weather conditions were included into the study as control parameters to see their effects on the frequency of fatal accidents occurring in work zones.                  Results:                       According to this study, there is evidence that nighttime construction is more hazardous than daytime construction. The inclusion of a weather parameter into the analysis has limited effect on this finding.                  Impact on industry:                       The study justifies establishing an efficient work zone accident reporting system and taking all necessary measures to enhance safety in nighttime work zones."
33,Safety climate and productivity improvement of construction workplaces through the 6S system: mixed-method analysis of 5S and safety integration,International journal of occupational safety and ergonomics : JOSE,"The purpose of this study is to develop a framework for integrating essential safety practices (visualization, job safety analysis and plan-do-check-act) into 5S steps and validate it. First, 18 interviews with a snowball sample of construction workers, safety representatives, supervisors and site and project managers were conducted. A grounded theory method was utilized to code the interview data. The results revealed that the studied construction companies implement a systematic safety-based methodology to minimize construction work injuries. Second, to validate the proposed framework, a pre-test and post-test study was applied. The case and control groups (26 participants) answered a 6S questionnaire before the 6S system and 1 month after implementation. The results revealed that safety climate and productivity significantly increased for the case group but reduced for the control group during time."
34,The role of production and teamwork practices in construction safety: a cognitive model and an empirical case study,Journal of safety research,"Problem:                       In construction, the challenge for researchers and practitioners is to develop work systems (production processes and teams) that can achieve high productivity and high safety at the same time. However, construction accident causation models ignore the role of work practices and teamwork. This study investigates the mechanisms by which production and teamwork practices affect the likelihood of accidents.                  Method:                       The paper synthesizes a new model for construction safety based on the cognitive perspective (Fuller's Task-Demand-Capability Interface model, 2005) and then presents an exploratory case study. The case study investigates and compares the work practices of two residential framing crews: a 'High Reliability Crew' (HRC)--that is, a crew with exceptional productivity and safety over several years, and an average performing crew from the same company.                  Results:                       The model explains how the production and teamwork practices generate the work situations that workers face (the task demands) and affect the workers ability to cope (capabilities). The case study indicates that the work practices of the HRC directly influence the task demands and match them with the applied capabilities. These practices were guided by the 'principle' of avoiding errors and rework and included work planning and preparation, work distribution, managing the production pressures, and quality and behavior monitoring.                  Summary:                       The Task Demand-Capability model links construction research to a cognitive model of accident causation and provides a new way to conceptualize safety as an emergent property of the production practices and teamwork processes. The empirical evidence indicates that the crews' work practices and team processes strongly affect the task demands, the applied capabilities, and the match between demands and capabilities.                  Impact on industry:                       The proposed model and the exploratory case study will guide further discovery of work practices and teamwork processes that can increase both productivity and safety in construction operations. Such understanding will enable training of construction foremen and crews in these practices to systematically develop high reliability crews."
35,Relationship between patient safety culture and safety performance in nursing: The role of safety behaviour,International journal of nursing practice,"Aim:                       The aim of this work is to test the mediator role of patient safety behaviour between safety culture and safety performance among nurses.                  Methods:                       This cross-sectional study was carried out between September and December 2017 in the nursing units of 10 primary hospitals, two secondary hospitals and two tertiary hospitals in Anhui Province, China.                  Results:                       The study participants comprised 79 RNs from primary hospitals, 147 RNs from secondary hospitals and 242 RNs from tertiary hospitals. Most were female (97.6%) and married (73.1%), and their ages ranged from less than 25 years to retirement age. The sample included nurses working in several departments, including medicine (27.1%), surgery (14.3%), emergency (11.5%) and ICU (9%). Structural equation model analysis results showed that espoused values directly affected safety performance, and practised values affected safety performance through safety behaviour.                  Conclusion:                       Our hypothetical model noted that safety behaviour is a positive mediating factor of practised safety values affecting safety performance, suggesting that Chinese nursing managers should construct a patient safety culture that is guided and driven by appropriate values, which will ultimately be externalized as nurses' daily behaviour."
36,Work-arounds in health care settings: Literature review and research agenda,Health care management review,"Background:                       As health care professionals seek to balance technological and regulatory demands with the need to provide patient-centered care, all in an efficient and cost-effective manner, they may see a greater need to improvise or work around intended work practices. Health care professionals acknowledge widespread use of work-arounds, and the literature documents their prevalence and influence on performance. Despite their importance, few studies have focused exclusively on work-arounds. This suggests a key area of need in the research, particularly because work-arounds are frequently cited in the context of serious patient safety consequences.                  Purpose:                       The purpose of this article is to review the existing literature concerning work-arounds to elucidate the definition and nature of work-arounds, how work-arounds can be differentiated from similar constructs (e.g., errors, mistakes, and deviance), and the potential causes of work-arounds and to explore potential consequences of work-arounds in health care settings.                  Approach:                       We conducted a systematic review of the literature concerning work-arounds to develop themes concerning the nature of work-arounds and ideas for future research on the topic.                  Implications for practice:                       In this article, we develop links between work-arounds and potential outcomes, particularly safety outcomes. Moreover, we discuss the manner in which open discussion can allow work-arounds to facilitate work process improvement and the role that climate and culture play in reducing work-arounds."
37,Barriers of Occupational Safety Implementation in Infrastructure Projects: Gaza Strip Case,International journal of environmental research and public health,"Infrastructure projects are the foundation for essential public services and have an influential position in societal development. Although the role of infrastructure projects is substantial, they can involve complexities and safety issues that lead to an unsafe environment, and which impacts the project key stakeholders. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the barriers to implementing occupational safety in infrastructure projects in the Gaza Strip, which cause serious threats and reduce project performance. To evaluate the barriers, 39 items were highlighted and modified as per the construction context and environment, and which later were distributed in the form of a questionnaire, to get feedback from consultants and contractors. The analysis shows that in the safety policy barriers group, consultants and contractors both ranked the item ""a contractor committed to an occupational safety program is not rewarded"" first. In the management barriers group, consultants and contractors both ranked the item ""safety engineer does not have significant powers, such as stopping work when needed"" in the first place. In the behavior and culture barriers group, consultants and contractors both ranked the item ""workers who are not committed to occupational safety are not excluded"" in the first place. Overall, both consultants and contractors shared the same viewpoint in classifying the barriers in the working environment. The outcome of this study is beneficial for Palestinian construction industry policymakers, so they can monitor the highlighted barriers in on-going infrastructure projects and can modify the safety guidelines accordingly."
38,A preliminary ergonomic analysis of the MRI work system environment: Implications and recommendations for safety and design,"Radiography (London, England : 1995)","Introduction:                       The MRI work system environment in acute hospitals poses a significant risk of harm to patients, healthcare practitioners and others, but knowledge of hazards and potential design improvements are limited as safety research is lacking. The aim of this exploratory study was to understand how the discipline of Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) can support the understanding and improvement of safety and performance of MRI working environments.                  Methods:                       A multi-method study of two MRI units in Scottish acute hospital settings based on Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) principles was undertaken in May 2016. Data collection sources included published literature, local and national safety incident data, site observations and staff interviews which were triangulated and subject to a content analysis.                  Results:                       A diverse range of system-wide hazards were highlighted which impact on the complexity of MRI work, patient and staff safety and system performance (e.g. adequacy of training and procedures, interactions with equipment, organisation of work). Preliminary recommendations were made to improve system design related to national approaches to safety (e.g. equipment procurement; staff training and procedural standards); interaction design and standardisation (e.g. physical design and barriers, staff uniforms, checking processes); and introduction of MRI passports for patients.                  Conclusions:                       This exploratory study suggests the need for national co-ordination and standardisation of MRI safety management strategies, based on safety science and HFE evidence and approaches to improve system design and reduce risk to patients, staff and others. A series of provisional recommendations are offered for consideration."
39,Correlation of causal factors that influence construction safety performance: A model,"Work (Reading, Mass.)","Background:                       The construction sector has presented positive development regarding the decrease in occupational accident rates in recent years. Regardless, the construction sector stands out systematically from other industries due to its high number of fatalities.                  Objective:                       The aim of this paper is to deeply understand the causality of construction accidents from the early design phase through a model.                  Methods:                       This study reviewed several research papers presenting various analytical models that correlate the contributing factors to occupational accidents in this sector. This study also analysed different construction projects and conducted a survey of design and site supervision teams.                  Results:                       This paper proposes a model developed from the analysis of existing ones, which correlates the causal factors through all the construction phases.                  Conclusions:                       It was concluded that effective risk prevention can only be achieved by a global correlation of causal factors including not only production ones but also client requirements, financial climate, design team competence, project and risk management, financial capacity, health and safety policy and early planning. Accordingly, a model is proposed."
40,A qualitative investigation of factors influencing unsafe work behaviors on construction projects,"Work (Reading, Mass.)","Background:                       Unsafe behavior is an important component in the chain of accident occurrences, and thus plays a key role in the accident prevention programs in construction sites.                  Objective:                       The aim of this qualitative research is to study the perception of frontline workers, supervisors, and managers about the preconditions of and contributing factors to unsafe behaviors in civil engineering projects.                  Methods:                       Field observation, in-depth interview, and focus group discussion are conducted with 113 informants from various mega projects during a 2-year time period. Fishbone diagram is applied to describe a conceptual model.                  Results:                       The results point to fourteen themes within four categories of the conceptual model - general management, organizational factors, safety supervision and management, and individual characteristics.                  Conclusions:                       General management and organizational culture were introduced as important preconditions and contributing factors resulting in human error and unsafe behavior in the construction sites. The fishbone diagram reveals the sequence and interaction of preconditions and contributing factors. The key contributing factors and their influences on unsafe behaviors are discussed along with recommendations for future directions."
41,Improving safety climate through a communication and recognition program for construction: a mixed methods study,"Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health","Objectives:                       This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a safety communication and recognition program (B-SAFE), designed to encourage improvement of physical working conditions and hazard reduction in construction.                  Methods:                       A matched pair cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted on eight worksites (four received the B-SAFE intervention, four served as control sites) for approximately five months per site. Pre- and post-exposure worker surveys were collected at all sites (N=615, pre-exposure response rate of 74%, post-exposure response rate of 88%). Multi-level mixed effect regression models evaluated the effect of B-SAFE on safety climate as assessed from surveys. Focus groups (N=6-8 workers/site) were conducted following data collection. Transcripts were coded and analyzed for thematic content using Atlas.ti (version 6).                  Results:                       The mean safety climate score at intervention sites, as measured on a 0-50 point scale, increased 0.5 points (1%) between pre- and post-B-SAFE exposure, compared to control sites that decreased 0.8 points (1.6%). The intervention effect size was 1.64 (3.28%) (P-value=0.01) when adjusted for month the worker started on-site, total length of time on-site, as well as individual characteristics (trade, title, age, and race/ethnicity). At intervention sites, workers noted increased levels of safety awareness, communication, and teamwork compared to control sites.                  Conclusions:                       B-SAFE led to many positive changes, including an improvement in safety climate, awareness, teambuilding, and communication. B-SAFE was a simple intervention that engaged workers through effective communication infrastructures and had a significant, positive effect on worksite safety."
42,Patient safety culture in the Primary Health Care,Revista brasileira de enfermagem,"Objective:                       To evaluate thepatient safety culturein thePrimary Health Care (PHC).                  Method:                       A cross-sectional study with 349 health professionals and PHC managers from a city of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The tool used was Safety Attitudes Questionnaire Ambulatory Version. Data-independent double typing and descriptive and inferential statistical analysis were performed.                  Results:                       The total score varied between 3.4 and 8.4 with mean (7.0 Â± 1.3), positive evaluation in the ""Patient Safety"" domain (8.2 Â± 2.0). Working on the Family Health Strategy and having five to 12 years of work was significant for positive culture. The recommendations to improve the safety culture were: Implementation of protocols, training, communication improvement and resolvability.                  Conclusion:                       The patient safety culture prevailed. Establishing a constructive safety culture with safe behaviors represents factors for improving patient safety in Primary Care settings."
43,Health Behaviours in Scaffold Use Risk Assessment Model - SURAM,Annals of agricultural and environmental medicine : AAEM,"Introduction:                       Problems concerning occupational safety and health are commonly found in the construction industry, including falling materials, tools or people from a height, stepping on objects, and injuries caused by hand tools. An important factor in occupational safety in the construction industry is the use of scaffolds. All scaffolds used in construction, renovation, repair (including isolating, painting and decorating) and demolition, should be erected, maintained and dismantledin accordance with safety procedures. Therefore, it is crucial to deal with the safety of scaffolds and risk assessment in the construction industry; thus, the way of undertaking the assessment and the liability of assessment seems to be essential for professionals. However, it has been found that those professionals are prone to rely heavily on their own experience and knowledge in decision-making regarding risk assessment.                  Material and methods:                       The Scaffold Use Risk Assessment Model (SURAM) has been developed for assessing risk levels at various stages of the construction process in various work trades. The SURAM is the result of a research project carried out at 60 construction sites in Poland and Portugal where 504 observations have been completed including both harmful physical and chemical factors, stress level, workers' habits, as well as a hundreds ex-post reconstruction of construction accidents scenarios.                  Results:                       It was found that the workers' Health Behaviour Index (HBI) seems to be a more direct predictor for development of the unsafe chain of events leading to an accident than the workload, and concentration of harmful factors at the workplace.                  Conclusions:                       The developed HBI module of SURAM seems to be beneficial for predicting high-risk construction activities, and thus preventing the occurrence of accidents, based on a set of historical accident data."
44,Speeding in highway work zone: An Evaluation of methods of speed control,Accident; analysis and prevention,"Highway workers frequently work in close proximity of live traffic in highway work zones, traffic accidents therefore have devastating effects on worker safety. In order to reduce the potential for such accidents, methods involving use of advisory signs and police presence have been used to mitigate accident risks and improve safety for highway workers. This research evaluates the magnitude of the speeding problem in highway work zones and the effects of four levels of police presence on improving work zone safety. Speed data were collected in six different work zone locations in northern and southern California and used to determine the magnitude and nature of speeding problem in highway work zones. In addition data were collected over 11 test-days in four work zones with four levels of police presence: radar speed display with police decal and lighting, passive use of a police vehicle with radar speed display, passive use of a police vehicle without radar speed display, and active police speed enforcement near work zones. This paper analyzes this data using statistical methods to evaluate the effectiveness of these different methods of speed control on the safety of the work zone. Four Measures of Effectiveness (MOE) were used in this evaluation consisting of average speed reduction, speed variance, 85th percentile speed, and proportion of high speed vehicles. The results indicate that all levels of police presence provided statistically significant improvements in one or more of the MOEs."
45,Leadership skills for strengthening jobsite safety climate,Journal of safety research,"Introduction:                       Construction foremen may lack the leadership skills needed to create a strong jobsite safety climate. Many construction companies address this by sending their lead workers to the OSHA 30-h course; however the course does not include a leadership training module. This article describes the development and pilot testing of such a module and evaluation surveys designed to address this training gap.                  Methods:                       A 17-member curriculum development team, numerous subject matter experts, and an instructional design company helped us develop a comprehensive set of teaching resources and a set of survey instruments for evaluating the materials' effectiveness on improving safety leadership and safety climate. All materials and surveys were pilot tested with representative members of the target population.                  Results:                       Pilot surveys showed high reliability and data collected on the resulting Foundations for Safety Leadership (FSL) module indicated that the majority of foremen thought the training was helpful or valuable, particularly the discussion questions. The majority said they intended to use the skills on the jobsite. With the exception of the role-play activities, the trainers rated highly all other components, especially the videos and discussion questions. Modifications were made to the training materials and surveys based on pilot test findings. The most important result of the development and pilot testing efforts is that the OSHA Training Institute (OTI) included the FSL as an elective in the OSHA 30-h course.                  Conclusions:                       The FSL module fills a needed skills gap by providing safety leadership training to all foremen who might otherwise not have access to it through their company or union. The continued success of the FSL training will be ensured by dissemination via the OSHA 30-h course, an established nationwide safety training program. Practical applications: The FSL training module has already been widely accepted by the construction industry as a useful approach for providing construction foremen/See new abstract lead workers with the knowledge and skills they need to become more effective jobsite safety leaders."
46,"Safety, incentives, and the reporting of work-related injuries among union carpenters: ""you're pretty much screwed if you get hurt at work""",American journal of industrial medicine,"Background:                       In the high-risk construction industry little is known about the prevalence or effects of programs offering rewards for workers and/or their supervisors for improved safety records or those that punish workers in some way for injury.                  Methods:                       We conducted an anonymous survey of 1,020 carpenter apprentices in three union training programs to document prevalence of their exposure to such efforts. We explored associations between perceptions of the reporting of work-related injury and elements of these programs.                  Results:                       Fifty-eight percent (58%; n = 592) reported some safety incentive or negative consequence of work-related injuries on their current jobsite. Reporting of work-related injuries was 50% less prevalent when workers were disciplined for injury experiences. Otherwise, we saw minimal evidence of association between injury reporting practices and safety incentive programs. However, considerable evidence of fear of reprisal for reporting injuries was revealed. Less than half (46.4%) reported that work-related injuries were reported in their current workplace all or most of the time; over 30% said they were almost never or rarely reported.                  Conclusions:                       There are multiple layers of disincentives to the reporting of work-related injuries that hamper understanding of risk and pose threats to workplace safety and productivity. These pressures do not arise in a vacuum and are likely influenced by a host of contextual factors. Efforts that help us understand variation across jobsites and time could be enlightening; such inquiries may require mixed methodologies and should be framed with consideration for the upper tiers of the public health hierarchy of hazard control."
47,How do organizational practices relate to perceived system safety effectiveness? Perceptions of safety climate and co-worker commitment to safety as workplace safety signals,Journal of safety research,"Introduction:                       Integrating safety climate research with signaling theory, we propose that individual perceptions of safety climate signal the importance of safety in the organization. Specifically, we expect that three work-related organizational practices (training effectiveness, procedure effectiveness, and work pressure) relate to the broader risk control system in the workplace via individual perceptions of safety climate as a broad management signal. Further, we expect this broad management signal interacts with a local environmental signal (co-worker commitment to safety) to amplify or diminish perceived system safety effectiveness.                  Method:                       In a field study of oil and gas workers (N = 219; Study 1), we used mediation modeling to determine the relationships between work-related organizational practices, perceived safety climate, and perceived safety system effectiveness. In a field study of railway construction workers (N = 131; Study 2), we used moderated mediation modeling to explore the conditional role of co-worker commitment to safety.                  Results:                       We found that training effectiveness, procedure effectiveness, and work pressure predicted perceived system safety effectiveness indirectly via perceived safety climate (Studies 1 and 2) and that these indirect paths are influenced by co-worker commitment to safety (Study 2).                  Conclusions:                       Findings suggest that perceived safety climate is driven in part by work practices, and that perceived safety climate (from managers) and co-worker commitment to safety (from the local environment) interact to shape workplace safety system effectiveness. Practical applications: The insight that training, procedures, and work pressure are meaningful predictors of perceived safety climate as a signal suggests that organizations should be cognizant of the quality of work-related practices for safety. The insight we offer on the competing versus complimentary nature of managerial safety signals (perceived safety climate) and co-worker safety signals (co-worker commitment to safety) could also be used by safety personnel to develop safety interventions directed in both areas."
48,Evaluating effectiveness of an integrated return-to-work and vocational rehabilitation program on work disability duration in the construction sector,"Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health","Objective:                       The aim of this study was to investigate whether an integrated return-to-work (RTW) and vocational rehabilitation (VR) program - the Work Reintegration (WR) program - was associated with reduced work disability duration in the construction sector in Ontario, Canada.                  Methods:                       Workers' compensation data from the Ontario Workplace Safety and Insurance Board were extracted for lost-time construction worker claims following work-related injuries between 2009 and 2015. Claims receiving referrals to RTW and VR specialists (treatments) were matched with claims receiving no referrals (controls) during the periods before and after the WR program introduction. Multivariable difference-in-differences linear and quantile regression models were used to examine differences in cumulative disability days paid during two-years post-injury between treatment and control groups before and after the program change and the difference in these differences, overall, and at different disability distribution percentiles.                  Results:                       The WR program introduction was associated with reductions in cumulative disability days paid for all claims but most notably among longer duration claims referred to RTW specialists (reduction of 274 days at the 90th percentile in the disability distribution) and shorter duration claims referred to VR specialists (reductions of 255 and 214 days at the 25th and 50th percentiles in the disability distribution, respectively).                  Conclusions:                       The WR program introduction was effective in reducing cumulative disability days paid for construction worker claims but the effects varied at different percentiles in the disability distribution, as well as by specialist referral. The findings highlight the benefits of better integrated RTW and VR services to injured workers in the construction sector."
49,A hybrid simulation approach for integrating safety behavior into construction planning: An earthmoving case study,Accident; analysis and prevention,"One of the key challenges in improving construction safety and health is the management of safety behavior. From a system point of view, workers work unsafely due to system level issues such as poor safety culture, excessive production pressure, inadequate allocation of resources and time and lack of training. These systemic issues should be eradicated or minimized during planning. However, there is a lack of detailed planning tools to help managers assess the impact of their upstream decisions on worker safety behavior. Even though simulation had been used in construction planning, the review conducted in this study showed that construction safety management research had not been exploiting the potential of simulation techniques. Thus, a hybrid simulation framework is proposed to facilitate integration of safety management considerations into construction activity simulation. The hybrid framework consists of discrete event simulation (DES) as the core, but heterogeneous, interactive and intelligent (able to make decisions) agents replace traditional entities and resources. In addition, some of the cognitive processes and physiological aspects of agents are captured using system dynamics (SD) approach. The combination of DES, agent-based simulation (ABS) and SD allows a more ""natural"" representation of the complex dynamics in construction activities. The proposed hybrid framework was demonstrated using a hypothetical case study. In addition, due to the lack of application of factorial experiment approach in safety management simulation, the case study demonstrated sensitivity analysis and factorial experiment to guide future research."
50,The Construction and Effect Analysis of Nursing Safety Quality Management Based on Data Mining,Computational intelligence and neuroscience,"Data mining belongs to knowledge discovery, which is the process of revealing hidden, unknown, and valuable information from a large amount of fuzzy application data. The potential information revealed by data mining can help decision-makers adjust market strategies and reduce market risks. The information mined can be the discovery of a particular study and little known, which must be based on the principle of truth. Nursing safety means that during nursing work, the nursing staff must strictly follow the nursing system and operating procedures, accurately execute doctor's orders, implement nursing plans, and ensure that patients get physical and mental safety during treatment and recovery. This paper aims to explore the construction of nursing safety quality management system and its effect analysis based on data mining. It is hoped that improvements in hospital nursing processes will provide better nursing services for patients using data mining techniques. This paper uses the FP algorithm to mine the data set and generates frequent itemsets, proposes and implements the association rule mining algorithm, and obtains the association rules with practical reference value. This article analyzes the current status and existing problems of nursing management, and puts forward some problems existing in the current nursing management staff's own quality, nursing quality system standards, and nursing management system. The experimental results in this article show that there are 42 cases of poor nursing due to lack of basic medical knowledge, accounting for 52%; there are 12 cases of poor nursing due to their own diseases, accounting for 15%; there were 7 cases of poor nursing due to lack of communication, accounting for 9%; there were 15 cases of poor nursing caused by unreasonable use of restraint devices, accounting for 19%. From these data, it can be seen that patients need to have basic medical knowledge and act in strict accordance with doctors' orders. Family members also need to accompany the patients more and cooperate with all parties in order to maximize the effectiveness of care."
